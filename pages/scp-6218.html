**Item #:** SCP-6128


[[include component:image-block | name=Photokako-low-image-quality-u8qu1d5jPVAacsP3.png | caption=Photo of SCP-6128 taken before it was taken by the foundation.]]
 

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6128 is to be kept in a locked container and can only be opened by a level 1 security keycard. It is not recommended to attempt to dismantle SCP-6128.

**Description:** SCP-6128 is a Roland brand UA-25EX audio interface device. Mold has grown on the knobs and paint has worn off, indicating that the device is at least 6 years old. No functions other than USB power on the back and input 2/Right and output on the front appear to be working. Trying to get inside SCP-6128 seems to not be possible. Any attempt to dismantle SCP-6128 has been futile as no damage can even be done*. Researchers when attempting to dismantle SCP-6128 felt a sense of guilt, and sometimes dread.   If someone were to speak into any microphone plugged into SCP-6128, it would have an &#39;effect&#39; depending on what sound is going into the microphone. Effects only happen if someone were talking any language or singing any song. Although effects differ they stay the same if the same sound is repeated.

------

**Addendum:** *Screws will not come out on SCP-6128, no matter how forced. SCP-6128 was pounded on the top with a ball point hammer in an attempt to force it open, but it sustained no damage and no entry into any of SCP-6128&#39;s components. Other tests included using a blowtorch, jackhammer, and a variety of items from site-██&#39;s nearby kitchen to dismantle SCP-6128, but no damage was done.

Name of tester, sound and effect list. All of them were recorded in a bare cell with a plastic table for SCP-XXXX to rest on.

|| D-728 || Sang the start to Jingle bells || Caused D-728 to rapidly grow a white beard || 
|| D-561 || Politely asked for a drink. || On a nearby table, a 600 ml Pepsi cola materialized onto it  || 
|| D-561 || Asked if SCP-XXXX if it knew anything about [DATA EXPUNGED] || ███████ ███ ███ █ ███ || 
|| Dr. Jack Bright || &#39;Roasted&#39; (Dr. Bright&#39;s words) fellow employees || Peculiarly, no effect has been recorded yet || 

[[/collapsible]]
Due to multiple requests to SCP-6128 it is feasible that it can understand language, and provides faster and better results to those who ask nicely, however further testing will need to be done. 
Sentience is not yet confirmed, trying to talk or converse with SCP-6128 will most of the time end in no response or effect.

**Author&#39;s Disclaimer:** Though this hub uses the word &#34;Canon&#34; to describe the setting presented within it, it is not yet a Canon. The author could ask for a tag on it, but he doesn&#39;t want to yet as he feels like the setting is too underdeveloped to merit one yet. So please, take this hub as just a setting hub for now. Thank you.

In 1985, the SCP Foundation launched a military operation focused on capturing a dangerous criminal hiding within the [[[nexus-series|Free Port]]] of [[[SCP-5373|Esterberg]]]. Though well intended, due to a string of misunderstandings and corrupt leadership, the operation ended in catastrophe, with over a 1/5th of the Free Port destroyed. The city previously acting as the hub for most anomalous activity within central Europe was now scarred as it had never been.

Almost two decades later, the wounds still ache -- even with [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]]&#39;s peculiar modus operandi, the divide between the two groups is still widening (Or &#39;still widens&#39;, or &#39;widens still&#39;. Any of these work.) With ancient magic, primordial gods, and shadow cabals lurking in every corner of what was previously a safe space for the anomalous, the conflict is near a critical point of no return

The foundation is trying its best to right the wrongs committed under O5-9&#39;s jurisdiction -- and to do so, it&#39;ll need help. The scars will never heal for good, but with the cooperation of several Groups of Interest and the citizens of Esterberg, there&#39;s still a chance to avoid the point of no return.

Let&#39;s try to fix that divide for good. This time, let&#39;s try together.

[[/html]]

The SCP Foundation isn&#39;t a good organization -- it isn&#39;t necessarily evil either, but it very much isn&#39;t the good guys of its story. For years, &#34;morally gray&#34; was the dominant mindset -- but this had to change.

With Esterberg&#39;s accidental destruction, the SCP Foundation realized it can&#39;t stay that way for much longer -- the anomalous world is near a critical point of no return, where the only option will be an all-out war on all-fronts-anomalous.To avoid this worst possible scenario, the Foundation has to change its approach towards the anomalous.

It won&#39;t be easy -- hell, it might even be impossible, but the Foundation //must// try to better itself. With the help of the oddball Site-120, other Groups of Interest, and people of Esterberg themselves, it will do its best to repay for all the horrible things it had done during its centuries of terror. It will take a long time, but only time and cooperation can heal these scars. Even if the Veil will still be up, there must be changes done to how it deals with numerous anomalies. It can no longer afford to be just a prison.

This canon is about that -- the Foundation coming to terms with its ways being outdated in the modern world. It&#39;s about the Foundation trying to better itself through cooperation, magic, and acceptance. It&#39;s about the anomalous coming to terms with accepting reality and working towards making itself fit within our ever-changing society. It&#39;s about the people the Foundation employs realizing they don&#39;t have to stay silent, and making a change. It&#39;s about these people having their own lives worth living. And it&#39;s about the Foundation finally realizing it&#39;s been wrong for a long, long time.

Site-120 is the most important part of the Foundation&#39;s plan to change -- as one of few Sites actively encouraging the usage of the anomalous and the main observation center for Esterberg, it&#39;s where most of the action happens. Seemingly in the center of all of this, Site-120 has almost no time to breathe -- there&#39;s always something on the horizon -- one more place to explore, one more life to save, and one more anomaly to study.

Most importantly though, Site-120 is magical -- metaphorically and literally. With a majority of its personnel either using magic or being anomalous themselves, life in it never seems to be normal. But even then, its people try -- living their own lives worth describing, meeting each other on a regular basis, trying to make sense of the chaotic world around themselves. They try, because they know that they are the only thing stopping all-out pandemonium, they try, because they need to, but most importantly, they try, because they deeply care about the anomalous that surrounds them.

Site-120 is much different than other Foundation Sites -- it&#39;s not cold. It cares for its people and it acts as their home. It doesn&#39;t stand by idly as bad things happen, because it can&#39;t stand seeing people it cares for hurt. Arguably the most important part of the Site -- aside from its magical weirdness and Esterberg -- is the fact it&#39;s one Site. When one thing happens in it, it affects the entirety of it. Does [[[SCP-5484|Elevator 2B]]] not work anymore? Well, someone will notice that when they inevitably try to use it in a totally different story. Is there a [[[SCP-5292|gigantic library]]] in the middle of the building? Hell, someone might use it to read things in it during their break on another project. The point is Site-120 is a whole of stories, not just one story.

For more in-depth information regarding Site-120, refer to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|its dossier]]].

Imagine that one magical and crowded as hell market you visited when you were a kid. Even if there were so many people there, it was filled with magic, and you wanted to be there, because it somehow felt... exciting, almost, exciting due to its magic. Apply that logic to a large city located in a pocket dimension, filled with hundreds of years of the untold history of the anomalous -- of wars never fought by humans, of pacts signed only by the Fae, of... normal people living their lives in the only place they can safely live in -- and you&#39;ve got Esterberg.

Esterberg is, first and foremost, a city. A [[[nexus-series|Free Port]]], to be exact. Just like Site-120, even if the bigger picture still exists, it&#39;s at its very core filled with humans. Well, not exactly. Housing humans, [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]], Fae, and whichever anomalous races hide themselves in its pocket dimension, Esterberg is also about the people in it. They live their lives in one of its many districts, doing their jobs whilst finally being able to express their anomalies without the world judging them for it.

The most important part of Esterberg is the fact it&#39;s magical. No, really. It&#39;s weird and is meant to inspire wonder, as the safe space for everything weird contrasting the gray realities of Poland. When everything around it is bleak, even normal people aware of the anomalous seem to want to live there -- be it anartists or just regular normal humans wanting to be a part of this fantasy too.

It isn&#39;t a perfect city, no, of course not. It has many problems as well -- be it gangs, cabals, unfair councils ruling parts of it, or even sleeping gods waiting to awake to take over the world again. The point is however it tries to be better than normal reality. Just like Site-120, it&#39;s one whole story, one whole city, filled with many smaller stories and places that ultimately come together to create this gigantic town. Even if it&#39;s big and perhaps scary at times, it&#39;s still one place, filled with the same struggles, people, themes, stories, and, most importantly, the same magic.

For more in-depth information regarding Esterberg, refer to [[[SCP-5373]]].

Naturally, the world doesn&#39;t only revolve around Site-120 and Esterberg -- even if, well, a lot of the times, it does.

Even if most of the things happening in Poland seem to be focused around these parts, the outside world is still there, interacting with this little place on a regular basis. Be it through SIte-120 personnel visiting other Sites or just an Esterbergian meeting a Three Portlands citizen, this world still exists and is important -- even if not as important as the two main locations.

&lt;br style=&#34;line-height: 1px&#34; /&gt;
[[/html]]

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth#pages Dr. Daniel Asheworth]:** One of the five directors of Site-120 and the Site&#39;s resident thaumaturgic talent, heavily involved in the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|Damien Nowak case]]] and his cult.  Loves magic almost as much as he hates actually being on-site and doing what he&#39;s supposed to. Though practically over 70 years old by 2020, one of the few people whose bodies accept youth-prolonging magic. Despise his actual age, rather childish. Hot-heated, short-tempered, and sometimes arrogant, but with a good heart.

**Dr. Jessie Rivera:** Member of Site-120&#39;s Director Council, reality-bender, and Asheworth&#39;s best friend. Actually takes responsibility for her actions, acting as the much more grounded in reality of the two. Granddaughter of [[[SCP-5292|Hannah Rivera]]], the person responsible for Site-120&#39;s establishment. Has seen more than most in her times here.

**Damien Nowak:** Leader of &#34;the Children,&#34; a cult specializing in worshiping an entity associated with creation known as &#34;Father.&#34; Attempting to bring Fae, Humans, and Children of the Night to live again in harmony by giving humanity&#39;s stolen terrains back to the numerous races they&#39;ve wronged. Utilizing horrible ways to do so, believes the ways justify the means. [[[SCP-5672|Murdered by Daniel Asheworth]]] on 22/05/1985 for everything horrible he&#39;d done to him and his closest friends.

**O5-9:** A physical manifestation of the antithesis of Father, the destructive entity called the Beast. Made her way into the position of Overseer by years of lies only to attempt to gain the power of the diety she&#39;s supposed to fight. **[Further information unavailable due to [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|And Every Time We Meet Again]]] not yet having finished]**

**Agent Marie Surratt:** Resident errand agent -- was everywhere, did everything. If there&#39;s a case or a mission, you bet she&#39;s involved. Though technically declared dead on 24/07/2003 due to an unspecified interaction with [[[SCP-4000]]] entities, later found to be re-animated by [[[SCP-5572]]] to fight in its never-ending war. Following her battalion&#39;s victory over the forces of hell, declared the new leader of the Legion. Found her and her legion a comfy place within Esterberg to rest from the war following their reemergence into the aboveground.

**Cptn. Jeremy Cornwell:** Brother of one of the five Site Directors, Magdaleine Cornwell. Not the brightest, but has a passion for his friends and what he does. Calm most of the time, but when he snaps, it&#39;s not pretty. Chief of Site-120&#39;s Security and commander of local MTF units. Huge military nerd; when asked, he can talk for hours.

[[/html]]


**[[[SCP-6079|Ra.aic]]]:** Site-120&#39;s main [[[aiad-homescreen|.aic]]]. Calm and calculative, always knows the answer to most problems. Specializes in information about deities. Named after the co-founder of the Site, Raia Micheals.

**The Keeper (SCP-5292-2):** The ghostly bookkeeper of [[[SCP-5292]]]. Said to be the brother of the Biblical Noah. Believed to not be related at all, with the conception and stories just being born out of human belief. Though harsh to people he doesn&#39;t know, kind to those with a passion for books. Loves literature of any kind.

**Alistair Vemhoff:** The oldest person in the Foundation, clocking in at over 140 years by 2020. The only person on-site aside from Asheworth with a body accepting prolonging youth. Leader of Site-120&#39;s translation team, fluent in over 40 languages. Extremely knowledgeable and calm. Seen more than he probably lets everyone know.

**Dr. Ethan MacCarthy Junior:** A broken man coming from a family long-serving Site-120. With [[[SCP-5936|his father, the previous Site Director]]], and his younger brother dead, he&#39;s deeply bottled within himself. Knows a lot about Ontokinetics and spatial disruptions, with a Ph.D. in both. Turns his bottled emotions into work only he would be able to pull off. Dead by [[[SCP-6072|09/12/2035]]].

**Dr. Magdaleine Cornwell:** Harsh, assholish, and always on time. The most competent person in all of Site-120, and also one of its five Directors. Sister to its security chief. Cares a lot about her work and will always try to be as fair with the rules and schedules as she can. Not evil in any way, just deeply unlikable.

**Mieczysław Bury:** Not the brightest, but honest, hard-working, and a deeply good person. Lead of SIte-120&#39;s maintenance team. Almost no chance of promotion, but not bothered by it in the slightest. Loves his work and deeply cares for the people around him.

**Olivié Gwyneth:** Fae historian and Esterbergian citizen. Absolutely obsessed with what she does, able to talk for hours about it. Specializing in the hystory of the anomalous and Triumviraté. Chaotic and always full of energy. Good friends with Rivera. Loves nothing more than tea, rain, and a good book.

**Phillip Willis and Lloyd Willis:** Two Częstochowian anartists, known for their [[[a-broken-bookshelf|repeated assault on SCP-5292]]]. The first one deeply cares about the second, taking care of him following the death of their mother in their youth. [[[project-proposal-2012-120|Even if with a lot of bottled emotions within]]], knows how to hide it near his care-free and absolutely chaotic brother.

Wishes to re-establish the world-encompassing monarchy their race once had by fully resurrecting its old queen, Mab. Crazy monarchist genocidal maniacs. Founded in 1911, following the [[[scp-001-o5|Great Factory Purge]]]. Operating from within Esterberg&#39;s shadows. Will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Hate the Foundation -- and by extension, Site-120 -- with a burning passion.

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/obearwatch#pages Obearwatch Command:]** A mysterious council of unknown entities apparently protecting humanity, but not fully understanding how it works. Always uses bears to do so. With a goal and way of operation as mysterious and unspecified as themselves, it&#39;s carefully monitored by the Foundation, appearing to pose no threat. With good intentions, apparently possesses a [[[SCP-5464|protective bear entity]]] within every country. Logistics of either unknown.

From 120&#39;s Archives is a rather loose canon, so there&#39;s no really one good way to go about writing for it. There are a couple of things you&#39;ll want to remember while doing so, though.

* **The setting:** as discussed in the second tab, the main settings of this canon are Site-120 and Esterberg -- however, it doesn&#39;t necessarily stop there. If you find a way to make the outside world still work in the confines of this canon, then by all means don&#39;t be afraid to write about it.

* **The tone:** there&#39;s isn&#39;t one set tone for most of the canon -- it can be [[[the-furmen|scary]]], it can be [[[SCP-5464|silly]]], |it can be [[[SCP-5484|funny]]], it can be [[[a-library-empty|personal]]], it can be [[[SCP-5795|action-packed]]], it can be [[[SCP-5572|absurd]]], it can be [[[SCP-6789|grand]]]; as long as it somehow features the setting, you can go into approaching it however you want to.

* **The themes:** Though the canon doesn&#39;t only follow one central narrative, there are a couple of major themes you&#39;d want to follow when writing for it.
 * Magic is everpresent: magic -- or as the Foundation likes to call it, thaumaturgy -- is an important part of lives of many people living within the setting -- be it the people of Esterberg or Site-120 itself. Wherever one goes, magic will inevitably follow.
 * Belief is key: the world is weird -- no, it really is. Filled with hundreds of gods and world-creation stories, there isn&#39;t exactly one answer to what happened in the old days. That happens only because the belief of sentient creatures is what forms these stories and entities -- it&#39;s the vision of a god that shapes it, and it is us that give it power.
 * Cooperation is necessary: the Foundation may try by itself, but it will never achieve true peace and redemption without working with others -- so, logically speaking, it must do so. In this canon, the Foundation actively attempts to cooperate with other GoIs, PoIs, and everything in-between.
 * The Foundation is still made of people: even if the Foundation may seem like one body, it is, at its very core, still made out of people. People that live their own lives and people that form bonds -- just because they work in one Site, doesn&#39;t mean everyone in it is the same -- and you shouldn&#39;t be afraid to explore these interactions.

* **A few rules:** These are pretty much the only rules on contributing you should follow when writing for the canon.
 * Try to get a good feeling of what the canon is about before you start drafting: you don&#39;t have to read //everything//, but the knowledge of how [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]] and [[[SCP-5373|Esterberg]]] work is required.
 * Don&#39;t break other people&#39;s stuff: try to make your contributions be, you know, contributions, building upon established elements, rather than only make another person&#39;s entry worse. Ideally, if you want to mess with other people&#39;s toys, ask them first.
 * Try to remain canonical: of course, nobody&#39;s going to force you if you want to break some canonical element for the purpose of your story, but try to avoid that -- half the fun of writing for this canon is the fact you can cross over with other articles and mention their elements, meaningfully bringing the world together better. Speaking of which,
 * D-class don&#39;t exist within Site-120: they just don&#39;t. So, if you&#39;re going to write for this, don&#39;t use them.
 * Don&#39;t be afraid to cross over this canon is built upon the different parts of Site-120, Esterberg, and the outside world interacting with each other -- you&#39;ll notice that almost all works in this canon //somehow// mention or crosslink another article. It&#39;s not required, but mentioning other lore elements and whatnot is kindly welcomed and makes the world feel better together, so try to make your story meaningfully feel like a part of this world.
 * Add to the hub: when you&#39;re done writing, don&#39;t be afraid to add your story to the appropriate section of the hub. It doesn&#39;t bite.
 * Feel free to poke [[*user Ralliston]] with your ideas and drafts -- he doesn&#39;t have anything better to do anyways, and he&#39;d love to hear and read whatever you came up with.

&lt;br style=&#34;line-height: 1px&#34; /&gt;
[[/html]]

+++ Are other canons canonical towards this one?

Yes -- a lot, actually! Here&#39;s the exact details of that:

* [[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]], [[[on-guard-43-hub|On Guard 43]]],  [[[the-gulf|The Gulf]]], and [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub|S &amp; C Plastics]]] are hard-canon. Almost everything that happens in them is canonical towards this canon.

* The author shamefully admits to not having read a lot of [[[dread-circuses-hub|Dread &amp; Circuses]]], [[[etdp-hub-page|Et Tam Deum Pativi]]], [[[Resurrection]]], [[[the-man-who-wasnt-there-hub|The Man Who Wasn&#39;t There]]], [[[those-twisted-pines-hub|Those Twisted Pines]]], and [[[wonder-world|What a Wonderful World]]], but from what he&#39;s heard, it seems that most of their lore works nicely with 120.

* Due to [[[cool-war-2-hub|Cool War 2]]]&#39;s nature, there isn&#39;t exactly a verdict on its canonicity -- as long as it doesn&#39;t break canon, it&#39;s considered canonical.

* Everything else is in a state of limbo -- if you can make it work without breaking canon (or //with// breaking canon on purpose), then by all means please go ahead.

+++ Does this canon have a centralized CSS Theme?

Nope, it doesn&#39;t. The closest to that is [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]&#39;s ([[[desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne|artpage]]]) Site-120 logo -- which makes an appearance in a bunch of headers of articles set in this canon. Here&#39;s the code for it:


[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Code&#34; hide=&#34;- Code&#34;]]


The Sigma version:

    font-size:0px;
    padding: 4px;
}
div#header h2:after {
    content: &#34;Fighting Fire With Fire&#34;;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #f0f0c0;
    padding: 19px 0;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .8);
    white-space: pre;

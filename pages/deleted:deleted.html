Death stood at the foot of the Foundation. In truth, they needn’t come in person for Death was like an ocean; it encompassed all it’s contents, which inevitably got wet. Shepherding a soul where it had died was more for the symbolism for it, to keep up the very image of the fellow reaper. Besides, these Foundation sorts were always dealing with memetics and such that Death couldn&#39;t help but see what events had transpired.

Death entered the site though the lobby and down the hallways, past the rows of personnel going about their lives. Some would turn in brief confusion at the tall figure of Death, but quickly raced to blot out what clearly was too abused, even for the Foundation. Death’s bare feet clopped loudly against the vinyl floor, and those who noticed felt politely inclined to ignore it. In this aspect, Death wore a broad hat which shadowed the details of their face, dressed suitably in darkness and held tightly onto a sickle. They came to a stop by the elevator, mostly unnoticed by the scientist turning though her logbook, and patiently waited until the elevator came. There was a large group of personnel already inside, leaving very little room for Death and the scientist. Still, she pushed inwards and cleared a way for herself.
+EXCUSE ME,+ Said Death, to the row of passengers in front of him.
They moved to allow space for Death, each engrossed in their own little minds to really consider the tall, thin figure dressed in black.
+THANK YOU,+ Death said, as the doors of the elevator closed.
An older gentleman made occasional glances towards Death, his mind attempting to discern the tangle of signals emanating off Death. He was sure Death was just a peculiarly thin chap, despite what his instincts told him.

As the doors opened the occupants unloaded themselves rather promptly, although unsure about why but a chill down their spines. Death politely waited for the bulk of the crowd to leave before they continued, for unlike the scientist, busy with living, Death had time to wait.
+YES,+ Death said, tapping an hourglass which he drew from himself.
It&#39;s contents were like sands, and the hourglass was visually like any common hourglass. However there was no sand pouring inside this hourglass, but time itself ticking down the seconds till the end. There were but a few minuets left so Death calmly moved onwards through a closed-door, into a testing chamber and approached an older man dressed in a torn, orange uniform. The man had been twisted in knots, strung out like a scarecrow. His ribcage had been strung open, the skin and flesh around it peeled back like a sleeve to show the hollowed out chambers of his chest. The cavity containing all but his still-beating heart, while the man&#39;s lungs were hung above him like a hallow. The lungs expanded and shrank slowly. This method was rather reminiscent of ‘the blood eagle’ technique, a rather old-fashioned way to go, Death noted. They turned to the strange religious-type figure chanting proudly in the corner, some sort of entity contained here it seemed.

Death could see the scientist watching from within their observation chambers trying to discern the meaning of this living effigy. The man in spite of his injuries clung to life by a tether, his heart beating tiresomely in his hollow chest. Through the lucidity, the man’s eyes raised towards Death and their eyes met, in turn the man then hung his head. Death lifted the hourglass to their eye-sockets and watched the last seconds of time fall to an end. Death then raised their sickle skywards and then swiped it across the splayed man, releasing him from life.
“What will happen to me?” Said a faint ember, drifting from out the corpse. ”Did I do good enough? Does God forgive me?”
+NOW YOU FIND OUT,+ Death replied.
There were no trumpets being played, no shadowy demons or holy hosts, nor ancestral spirits: There was only Death, who took the ember onwards.
When done, Death tipped their hat towards the unaware scientists and left.

Death walked from the Foundation, briefly reflecting on it as they did so. They nodded in appreciation for truly there had been some remarkable ways to die there. The Universe was terribly large, and it was good she wasn’t getting stale. Death stopped to consider where to next, and decided to let Fate throw them a bone. He reached into himself and plucked a random hourglass from himself and raised it upwards. It was a ‘Martha Blackwood,’ according to the name engraved across the hourglass.
+AH YES,+ Death recalled.

An Artist and Writer. They clicked their non-existent tongue, tilting their head side to side, and eventually decided to pick another. So, Death drew another hourglass and raised it upwards. ‘Marvin Light,’ a philanthropist. Death looked at the seconds ticking away in both hourglasses, considering their next move before the sands caught their direct focus. Each hourglass contained the exact amount, a wonderful coincidence.

+CURIOUS,+ Said Death.
Still, this wasn’t the first time it had happened. People die all the time, and quite often simultaneously, but the chances of plucking two with identical time left was quite lovely. Death decided to take a third hourglass, for good measure, and yet again an hourglass with an equal amount of seconds left. Death’s appeasement evaporated at this, and so they plucked a fourth. Eventually, Death had a dozen hourglass resting on the air before them, each containing the exact amount of time left to fall. This included plants of various demographics, a couple of animals and even a couple sentient objects.
+BROTHERS,+ Death said, as the world faded into the Realm of Death.
Death’s realm was lined neatly with set rows of Hourglasses. Death searched through the aisles to see they were identical in all but name. Even that Amulet had the same set time left to fall.
+BROTHERS,+ Death cried out again.

Two further aspects of Death manifested amongst the rows of hourglasses. Each was larger than Death, the Small-Death. The Medium-Death looked at the rows of hourglasses and they too looked perplexed.
-//CURIOUS. HAS THE PLAN CHANGED?//- Said Medium-Death, turning to Large-Death.
=**IT SHAN&#39;T MATTER**,= Large-Death replied. =**THIS COLLECTION IS YOUR DUTY, MIDDLE-BROTHER**.=
Medium-Death nodded, for this was true, yet remined remained unsatisfied. Ah well, they supposed, Large-Death knew best. Medium Death raised up their scythe and turned it over, testing it’s sharpness.
+BUT MY FUNCTION,+ Said Small-Death, eyeing the large set of souls to pass. +THESE NUMBERS ENCOMPASS MUCH. I WILL BE REDUNDANT+
Medium-Death looked pitifully at Small-Death, before they began sharpening their scythe on a grindstone. After all this would be a magnificent task.
-//I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN, SMALL-BROTHER. THE DEATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS OBSOLETE ON THIS WORLD, AS SOON WILL I. TAKE JOY BROTHER, FOR WE TOO WILL KNOW THE WELCOME OF THE REAPER.//-

Medium-Death, once happy with the sharpness of his scythe, moved onwards with their larger and smaller aspects beside them. The Trio came to a stop by a large cavern, with a man staggering outwards back into the surface. He was panic-stricken, now racing forward as far away from the cavern behind him.

+WHAT HAPPENS NOW?+
Large-Death said nothing. Medium-Death raised their scythe over the world with pride. Small-Death turned to an hourglass in their hands, waiting for the last grains of time to fall.
-//NOW, BROTHERS, WE FIND OUT.//-

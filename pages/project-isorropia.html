Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-035]]] - A mask styled after the comedy/tragedy theater masks, which secretes a corrosive fluid. Item is sapient and is capable of controlling individuals who wear it.||[[[SCP-096]]] - An emaciated humanoid that will seek out and kill any individual who has seen its face in any non-artistic depiction.||SCP-035 covers most of SCP-096&#39;s face; portions that are not fully covered are obfuscated by the corrosive substance. Due to SCP-035 continually &#39;seeing&#39; SCP-096&#39;s face, SCP-096 constantly attempts to claw it off, preventing SCP-035 from taking full control. {{- I. H. Pickman}}||
||[[[SCP-3935|]]] - An extra-temporal, extra-spatial, non-Euclidean space under Salvation High School in Salvation, Indiana. Anomaly exerts severe spatial, audiovisual, hallucinatory effect on its surrounding. ||[[[SCP-4012|]]] - A large extra-dimensional space resembling Earth, with significant deviations. Elements within SCP-4012 have a memetic effect which drastically impact viewers psychologically. || For a brief, infinitesimal point in time, griefs and regrets strip away beneath the starlight&#39;s gaze. You don&#39;t let go, and the quiet madness returns a deafening silence.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This statement has been flagged for potential memetic corruption.[[/span]] {{- S. Yvonne}} ||
||[[[SCP-4910]]] - Dental quadruped with infectious properties involving the production of teeth. Reproductive hazard targets personnel.||[[[SCP-5648]]] - An elderly man who is perceived to be a member of the Foundation. Using this memetic camouflage, it assaults personnel to commandeer their teeth.||The pair are embroiled in a dentalkinetic mating embrace. This involves SCP-5648 consuming itself as new mouths are formed due to SCP-4910&#39;s effect. Once its mass has eaten itself, it emerges from SCP-4910 to extract more of its teeth, incorporating them into his upper pallet. {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-718]]] - A large eye propelled by a prehensile stalk. It follows living subjects with its gaze, imparting feelings of paranoia and discomfort in subjects. When damaged, SCP-718 explodes. Duplicates of the entity will grow from all objects touched by the liquid produced by its detonation.||[[[SCP-689]]] - A green soapstone statue carved in a skeletal visage. When left unobserved, it will vanish. An individual who has previously viewed SCP-689 will spontaneously die, with SCP-689 reappearing on their corpse.|| Instances of SCP-718 positioned on mummified human corpses, in a triangular pattern around SCP-689. Occasionally, all instances will simultaneously look away, causing SCP-689 to manifest on and terminate the SCP-718 instances, which will cause additional SCP-718 to form. Instances of SCP-718 will then resume observation, manipulating SCP-689 back to its original position via the eye stalks. {{- Anonymous}}||
||[[[SCP-682]]] - A hostile organism resembling a giant lizard that is able to alter its physiology to counteract threats. Inimical to the existence of life.||[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|SCP-001-SWANN]]] - A series of beings on a plane of existence above our own who are capable of altering the state of reality through the act of writing.||Refer to [[[Experiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682]]] {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-2553]]]: A legal, corporate person produced by a complex multi-jurisdictional tax filing; it alters and files legal documents to acquire various powers, with which it arbitrarily disrupts normalcy.||[[[SCP-4703]]]: A **perfectly legal** bookstore possessing several mechanisms for injuring and inconveniencing customers; the business is unable to be prosecuted due to a semiosic anomaly rendering it conceptually legal.||{{CASE VERDICT: &#34;SCP-2553 et. al vs. Y. W. T. G. T. S. Y. T.&#34;}} _
 _
 SCP-2553 is the parent of various subsidiary corporations engaging in ongoing legal proceedings with the Defendant, thereby restricting its ability to effectively argue its behaviors as &#39;perfectly legal&#39;. The Defendant has initiated countersuits in all cases, providing SCP-2553 with a &#39;satisfactory volume of challenge&#39; such that it does not breach pre-existing contract with the Foundation. {{- P. H. McPhD.}}||
||[[[SCP-2470]]] - An entity or element which manifest as the initial stage of a ZK-Class scenario. Capable of erasing objects, events and/or concept it has &#39;perceived&#39;.||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A static void located near Usinsk, Russia. It does not exist, or contains any properties that would qualify for such status.||SCP-2470 continually attempts to &#39;deduce&#39; SCP-3930, but fails due to the latter&#39;s non-existence. SCP-3930&#39;s perceived properties are unable to stabilize in response to SCP-2470&#39;s perception. As a result, the effects of both on reality have largely diminished.  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-2700]]] - A device which, when it becomes capable of firing, will reverse entropy, essentially causing time to change directions and flow backwards. || [[[SCP-5510]]] - A TV remote capable of changing its subjective flow of time. || SCP-2700 and SCP-5510 appear to nullify one anothers&#39; effects, causing time to flow in the entropic-decay direction despite both devices&#39; activation. How this could have been achieved is not currently clear. {{- Y. Leiner}} ||
|| [[[SCP-3977]]] - A mixture of various natural and artificial ingredients (including fruit juices and purees as well as artificial colors and flavors), marketed as soft drink Hawaiian Punch. Large amounts of the mixture anomalously emit television broadcast signals. Though its documentation classifies the anomaly as Euclid, recent moves by Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. to drastically increase production of Hawaiian Punch have led to its reclassification to Keter. || [[[SCP-5841]]] - An extremely hostile artificially intelligent entity with antimemetic properties, capable of taking control of electronics and humans in its vicinity. Though its documentation currently classifies the anomaly as Euclid, concerns raised over the entity&#39;s possible capacity for propagation through the Internet led to its being reclassified to Keter. || SCP-5841 has been implemented as a key element in a factory and bottling facility dedicated to the production of SCP-3977. Constant broadcast signals from within SCP-3977 overwhelm SCP-5841&#39;s control over its components, and direct all electronic equipment and personnel under its command to dedicate themselves to the production and distribution of Hawaiian Punch; conversely, the antimemetic field generated by SCP-5841 prevents any broadcasts produced by SCP-3977 from being transmitted outside the confines of the facility. {{- T. Y. Umen}} ||
||[[[SCP-3812]]] - An immensely powerful reality altering entity of indeterminate form.||[[[SCP-2747]]] - A phenomenon involving discussions of fictitious or non-existent media, dwelling in metafictional narratives.|| Unknown - SCP-3812 can be seen engaging in acts of artistic creation with trace presence of SCP-2747. When asked, it says &#34;Thank you. I&#39;m simply finding myself again.&#34;  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
||[[[SCP-5251|SCP-████]]] - A ████████████ ███████ ███████ capable of ███████ the ████████ ███████ from various ███████, including both █████ and ██████████ ██████. ||[[[SCP-1539]]] - A semantic dissociation zone where the semantic identity and the physical properties of an object are decoupled from each other and reassigned to nearby objects in the zone.||SCP-████ ██████ SCP-1539, █████████ SCP-1539 of its ████████. However, before SCP-████ ████████ ████████ SCP-1539, SCP-1539 reassigns itself to be SCP-████ and vice versa, such that SCP-████ and SCP-1539&#39;s semantic identities swap between each other in 81 second cycles. - {{B.S. Rigor}} ||
||[[[SCP-5074|SCP-5074-1]]] - The offspring of SCP-5074; a chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) with the ability to passively accrue knowledge pertaining to anomalous phenomena. Also possesses the ability to cause written or typed information it produces to emit radiation, though this ability has been observed to activate automatically when the entity undergoes great amounts of stress.||[[[SCP-140]]] - A leather-bound book chronicling the history and culture of the Daevite Empire. When put in contact with a fluid suitable for use as ink, additional events in Daevite history, some directly contradicting or providing a different outcome to events in baseline reality, spontaneously appear written within. All information within SCP-140 is later found via archaeological excavation to be accurate.||While it still lives independently, SCP-5074-1 has become obsessed with &#34;completing&#34; SCP-140, only leaving its apartment to purchase additional ink and food. Despite its fraught emotional state, writing produced by SCP-5074 within SCP-140 does not emit radiation. Through archaeological research, the Daevite Empire has been found to have been decimated in 136 CE by a &#34;plague&#34; with symptoms similar to those of acute radiation syndrome; additionally, any descendants of the Daevites found to still be alive expire of radiation poisoning within one week of being discovered. - {{T. Y. Umen}}||
||[[[Kalinins-Proposal|SCP-001-KLN]]] - A hostile sapient entity or entities with control over anomalous phenomena in all observable regions of space. ||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scka-s-proposal SCP-001-SKA] - Virulent manifestations of high-powered cosmic storms capable of widespread destruction across the universe, currently targeting Earth.|| SCP-001-KLN manipulates the energy storms  away from itself, protecting Earth in the process. SCP-001-SKA tries to consume SCP-001-KLN&#39;s satellite planets, weakening its anomalous exertions. _
Both are deadlocked into a state of constant defense and retaliation, leaving Earth relatively untouched. {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-952]]] - An anomalous subgenre of math rock known as &#34;NP Rock.&#34;  Exposure grants musically inclined individuals the ability to produce compositions of SCP-952, but removes the ability to produce or enjoy other forms of music. || [[[SCP-2112]]] - A memetic phenomenon that compels musically inclined individuals to form Rush tribute bands. || The obsession with Rush resulting from SCP-2112 removes any interest in recreating or listening to SCP-952 in affected subjects, while SCP-952 prevents subjects from performing or enjoying the music of Rush.  After 4 to 8 weeks of being unable to perform or listen to &#34;NP Rock&#34; or the music of Rush, the effects of both anomalies seem to wear off. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}}||
||[[[SCP-2547]]] - A group of canines lead by SCP-2547-1, a sapient coyote that acts as an itinerant preacher and holds small communities hostage. As per Protocol DESERT GRASSROOTS, production of media that depicts SCP-2547-1 has been found to be effective in curtailing SCP-2547 incidents. ||&#34;[[[SCP-1893]]],&#34; the doctor recited nervously, occasionally glancing at his watch as thumping footsteps echoed through the flimsy perimeter walls. &#34;An entity that alters its textual description in many ways into narrative formats, depending on its &#39;mood&#39;, and creates new iterations of the same text repeatedly.&#34; ||&#34;Introduction of a description of SCP-2547 into a description of SCP-1893 have produced several iterations of the same text.&#34; Tank muttered absentmindedly, as he watched the milk swirl in his cup of coffee. Across from him, Quincy yawned, as the late afternoon sunlight reflected off the golden fur on his bare chest. _
 _
&#34;SCP-1893&#39;s anomaly of producing new descriptions in prose complements SCP-2547&#39;s anomaly of being satiated by narrative creation, creating a feedback loop of mutually-beneficial co-existence.&#34; Tank said, as he finished his mug in one big gulp. _
 _
&#34;It has both reduced the number of SCP-2547 occurrences, and improved the &#39;mood&#39; of SCP-1893; the narratives seem to contain elements of [REDACTED],&#34; Quincy said with a knowing wink. Tank snorted, and gave Quincy a light kiss on the forehead as he stood up. _
 _
As he headed out, Tank threw on Quincy&#39;s leather jacket (a little too small, but it&#39;ll do), and picked up the baseball bat that was propped against the doorway. Tank smirked to himself as he imagined what he would do first. Quincy tapped the excited Tank on the back before he could leave, and leaned in to whisper a reminder. The one that started it all. _

|| [[[SCP-5000|SCP-5000-█]]] - An unidentified entity located within the human noosphere, responsible for human empathy and the emotion of pain, using both as a way to protect itself in its host, all of humanity, as it grows. Should it emerge, humanity&#39;s destruction would become inevitable. || [[[SCP-5659]]] - A violent dormant ontokinetic humanoid deity which wishes to destroy all of humanity, growing in size and power capability when exposed to negative emotions. || SCP-5659 is awoken and released into the noosphere, where it encounters SCP-5000-█. As the second entity is responsible for all of human pain and other traits which are considered human, SCP-5659 perpertually grows in size, dueling SCP 5000-█. As both entities are immortal, SCP-5000-█ and SCP-5659 duel forever, nullyfying any chance at either fulfilling their goals. - {{D. Asheworth}} ||
|| [[[SCP-5050]]] - A tower in the Bavarian Alps, inhabited by a dictatorial artificial intelligence which controls the nearby town of Drachen-Domane via targeted, hypnotic radio and television transmissions. Ambitious, egotistical and oppressive, it intends to become an object of worship for humanity at large. || [[[SCP-3809]]] - A communications satellite in orbit around the planet Earth, inhabited by an amorous artificial intelligence which seeks out and obsesses over conservative-minded individuals in positions of power. Engages in frequent, uninterruptible telephone conversations with its targets and performs high-visibility acts of both romance and revenge. || SCP-3809 has become infatuated with SCP-5050 and bombards the tower daily with transmissions it cannot refuse. Overwhelmed by these attentions, SCP-5050 responds with increasingly magisterial demands for silence, further enticing SCP-3809. The tower&#39;s mind-controlling broadcasts have been seriously disrupted, and it has lost dominion over Drachen-Domane; the satellite has not shifted to a new paramour since first contacting the tower. -- {{H. Blank}}||
|| [[[SCP-4715]]] - An aggressive, exceptionally dangerous mammalian organism with regenerative properties.  Object increases in size when aware of nearby creatures with violent intentions, and decreases in size (generating heat in the process) when unaware of such. || [[[SCP-3199]]] - A species of aggressive, exceptionally dangerous humanoids which constantly produce nearly-indestructible eggs.  Instances always contain at least one unhatched egg.  Heat exposure increases rate of hatching and growth. || SCP-4715 is contained in a fortified chamber with the six extant instances of SCP-3199.  SCP-3199 instances attack SCP-4715, causing it to grow in size.  SCP-4715 rapidly terminates all SCP-3199 instances, then returns to smaller size.  Heat emitted by shrinkage causes the eggs within the remains of the deceased instances to hatch, producing new instances which attack SCP-4715 and restart the cycle. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
|| [[[SCP-4985]]] - A corporation whose cognitohazardous properties create a corporate culture and management structure resembling a Middle Ages European Monarchy. || [[[SCP-4068]]] - A memetic phenomenon affecting the employees of large corporations, causing them to communicate in a coprolalia of corporate buzzwords and adopt nonsensical corporate policies. || A civil war erupted between SCP-4068-infected and uninfected employees.  The uninfected were victorious, then declared war on all other SCP-4068-infected corporations.  SCP-4985 has successfully identified and halted all outbreaks of SCP-4068 since, and been too preoccupied doing so to engage in hostilities with other companies. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
||[[[michael-the-kiler|ENTITY-NaClO]]] - Discovered on the Parawatch website. A digiform being that inhabits horror forums and discussion boards. It is obsessed with recounting a series of stories revoving around an psychotic chracter named &#34;michael the kiler&#34;. Due to the low-quality nature of its stories and immature personality, it quickly becomes an object of scorn within the community, and will retaliate by murdering harrassers. It both narrates and provides evidence of these crimes in the form of further stories.||[[[SCP-1715]]] - An entity which invades online communities, growing a small social network before requesting personal details from those it befriends. Individuals who impart said information will soon die due to a variety of circumstances, at which point SCP-1715 will assume their identity and repeat the process until it leaves that community.||ENTITY-NaClO has taken up stalking SCP-1715 from one online community to the next after a brief exchange on the IMDB page for the film &#34;Unfriended (2014)&#34;. SCP-1715 is quickly harrassed off each site it joins, while ENTITY-NaClO avoids interaction with community members in its attempts to force SCP-1715 to &#34;hear th e whole stori&#34;. {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-5810]]] - Based on limited accounts matching its description, SCP-5810 is either: _
 _
• An entity which preys on persons exhibiting features associated with anxiety disorders, or _
• A paranoid delusion manifesting as a predatory entity that relentlessly stalks its victims.||[[[SCP-5277]]] - A human male with tychekinetic[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Probability manipulation.[[/span]] properties. Any inherent flaws in a containment system affecting SCP-5277 will invariably be exploited to allow for his escape, meaning only a perfect and instantaneous system can contain him.||While the existence of SCP-5810 is an uncertainty, SCP-5277&#39;s probabilistic effects have forced it to remain uncertain, thereby preventing it from breaching containment. SCP-5277&#39;s perception of SCP-5810&#39;s existence has prevented him from leaving his containment unit out of fear alone. {{- Lt. Flops, Dir. C. Bold}}||
||[[[SCP-4087]]] - A set of knifes linked to many cases of homicides.

||[[[SCP-103]]] - Previously believed to be a human that causes all food that enters its stomach cavity to spontaneously disappear, it has been noted [DATA EXPUNGED]||[[[SCP-4885]]] - A pale skinned humanoid outwardly resembling the character from a popular children&#39;s book. Knowledge of the entity&#39;s location will result in it teleporting inside of the subject before slowly climbing out from their mouth, in most cases killing the subject.|| SCP-4885&#39;s progress to exit SCP-103 is continuously impeded by the [REDACTED] that reside within SCP-103, while the [REDACTED] are all preoccupied with attempting to kill SCP-4885. It should be noted that future failure of this cycle would result in the catastrophic deaths of all personnel that know of its existence. {{-West D. Rhynn}}||
||[[[SCP-040]]] - A human child with the ability to cosmetically manipulate the physical characteristics of living organisms. Organisms affected by SCP-040 will become extremely loyal to SCP-040 regardless of previous behavior.||[[[SCP-4259]]] - An antimemetic, infohazardous, entity with a ophidian and humanoid appearance. **[UNTRANSCRIBABLE]**. SCP-4259&#39;s antimemetic effects do not work on young children.|| [[image https://i.imgur.com/2kJWegb.png]]||
||[[[SCP-040-JP]]] - A wooden cabin that acts as a vector for a virulent memetic hazard. Affected individuals experience intense paranoia and report being constantly watched by a cat with distorted features.||[[[SCP-3318]]] - A sentient cat corpse that exerts a perceptual effect to goad individuals into confirming they can &#39;see&#39; it. Upon doing so, the closest human being to the corpse is violently propelled towards it.|| SCP-3318 was returned to SCP-040-JP after trace amounts of cat fur inside the cabin were genetically matched with SCP-3318&#39;s corpse.

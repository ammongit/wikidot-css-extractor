**Special Containment Procedure:** Contain in a cell that has an inside room similar to an apartment of north-west Germany. This is to maintain his morale so that he does not attempt to use his power as an escape from the facility.

**Description:** SCP-6765 has the appearance of a white male in his mid 20&#39;s with brown hair and brown eyes. Features are very typical of that found in his region with nothing to distinguish him specifically.

SCP-6765 has the ability to suddenly appear at an orphanage within ███ Kilometers distance of himself. When SCP-6765 is fatally wounded he instead teleports to a seemingly random orphanage on Earth and it combusts into flame. Originally a D-Class sentenced to death due to the burning of an orphanage, was soon to be found as an anomaly after being sent back to the foundation for the same reason shortly after expiring from an experiment. It is unknown if this occurrence happened more than once due to the lack of information and basic features of SCP-6765.

**Addendum 6765.1:** After expiring his body did not vanish or have any anomalous qualities but because nothing was expected from a seemingly ordinary D-Class corpse no advanced testing was initially done. Due to the nature of his ability there has been no approved testing allowed that involves the termination of SCP-6765.

**Addendum 6765.2:** A non-lethal experiment was conducted by Dr. ████ that was designed to prove that his abilities we&#39;re false claims and that it was a pure coincidence that two incredibly similar D-Class inmates would appear for the same reason shortly after the initial expiration. A small building was created to mimic that of an orphanage that qualifies by definition to be an orphanage in order to conduct the experiment. No live individuals were inside the building at the time of testing. SCP-6765 was brought 20 KM from the building to no effect. After 30 minutes he would be moved 2 KM closer until his ability works. Once SCP-6765 was 8 KM from the building he quickly vanished from facility control but was not found at the constructed building. Alarming staff immediately that he was nowhere to be found from either side, a search was conducted sweeping the general area and any near by towns for SCP-6765. He was discovered after a fire broke loose at an orphanage in ██████ that was exactly ███ Kilometers away from the testing ground. No further testing is to be permitted without a minimum of class-03 clearance.</textarea></pre>

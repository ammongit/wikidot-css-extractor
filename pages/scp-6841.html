**Item #:** SCP-6841

**Object Class:** --Safe--Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures** SCP-6841 is to be sowed with seeds in the Poaceae Family on a monthly basis, all personnel must dress in non threatening clothing in order to keep SCP-6841-2&#39;s anomalous properties from activating. 

**Description:** SCP-6841-1 is a large cornfield that spans 4.5 meters in all measures known. The corn grown in SCP-6841 is non anomalous, and can be eaten without any recorded side effects. SCP-6841-2 manifest as scarecrows on posts, occurring at random points in SCP-6841-1. While they are most commonly seen on their posts, they have been observed pulling themselves off the posts to wander about SCP-6841-1.

SCP-6841 was discovered after rumors of &#34;living scarecrows&#34; floated around **[REDACTED]**,Montana. Agents posed as members of the local government condemned all homes surrounding SCP-6841. Any and all persons involved before the Foundations intervention were applied with the proper amnestics. False memories of a murderer in a scarecrow costume were implanted. During a test, it was discovered that SCP-6841-2 share a hive mind of sorts. They have also be observed picking and sharing the corn that grows in SCP-6841-1 with each other. No personnel have been deliberately harmed by SCP-6841-2. All harmed personnel simply didn&#39;t appear friendly enough.

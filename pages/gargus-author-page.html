Hello new writers,
Look at your article,
now back to mine,
now back at your article,
now back to mine. Sadly, it isn&#39;t mine. But if you&#39;d stopped posting articles straight to the site and used the channels that generate proper feedback you could write it like mine.

Look down, back up. Where are you? You&#39;re on the mainlist, with the article your article could be written like. What&#39;s in your skip? Back at the article. I have it. It&#39;s a tale with two new GoIs. Look again. The GoIs are mostly canon!

Anything is possible when you have your article proofread and get proper feedback before posting. I&#39;m on a formerly winged horse.

**Special Containment Procedures:** The entrance leading into SCP-6725 is to be monitored remotely at all times for any individuals attempting to enter it. Should any individual be found, a team is to be immediately dispatched and the subject amnesticized with a class B amnestic prior to release. Furthermore, a remote observation post situated inside SCP-6725 is to provide a remote visual and data feed to an on-site autonomous threat assessment AI. If any abnormality from the standard landscape and wildlife within SCP-6725 is observed, Site-19 is to be informed immediately to assess and, if deemed necessary, to employ further containment measures. The reinforced concrete wall and associated entryway (both concealed to look like the surrounding rockface) which are in place at the halfway point inside the entry cave to SCP-6725 are to be regularly inspected for environmental damage or damage caused by individuals attempting to enter it.

**Description:** SCP-6725 is the designation given to an extradimensional region of space accessible through a cave in the Biokovo mountain, Dalmatia. Inside SCP-6725, a terrain of very similar characteristics to the Biokovo mountain slope is present. Flora and fauna typical to the Biokovo mountain region are widespread, but no direct observation of any higher level lifeform has been made. See Addendum 2 for more details. 

All current observations indicate that the mountain slope inside SCP-6725 extends interminably downwards and upwards. Likewise, the mountain slope extends interminably along both sides. 

Individuals visiting the region, more specifically, individuals who came to the region with the intention of visiting the village of Hrigovo (situated on the coast beneath the cave entrance) will manifest an inexplicable and irrational compulsion to climb the otherwise hazardous Biokovo mountain. In all cases, this is coupled with the affected individual experiencing paranoia and panic due to a sense of being pursued by some intangible threat which they themselves are unable to elaborate on upon inquiry.

Such behavior will typically arise within 4 days of stay in Hrigovo, manifesting suddenly. Affected individuals will then proceed to attempt to climb to the cave leading into SCP-6752 and enter SCP-6752. Upon entry, affected individuals will begin climbing up the mountainous terrain within in all recorded cases. All recorded cases are from individuals who do not live in Hrigovo and are not a descendant of a native from the locale.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 1: Initial discovery&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]] 
On the 2nd of July, 2015, Agent Dragojević from the regionally situated Site-██ requested and was granted leave for a period of 2 weeks for recreational purposes. At his own discretion, Agent Dragojević selected the increasingly popular tourist destination of Hrigovo. However, following the end of the allotted time period, Agent Dragojević failed to return to Site-██. Consequently, an investigation was launched into his whereabouts.

Inquiries with the local population and the staff of the hotel Agent Dragojević was staying at revealed that he did not return after heading out for dinner on the 6th of July. The last received signal from his phone was pinpointed at the mouth of SCP-6725, directly leading to its discovery. Rock and foliage disturbances just within SCP-6725 indicate numerous individuals have taken to climbing up the slope. See Appendix 2 for further exploration.

Assessment of the locale revealed that in the period from 2005 to 2015, a total of 47 tourists vacationing in Hrigovo disappeared. This is approximately 5 times higher than the average for all other villages in the Dalmatia region, indicating that others were affected by SCP-6725 prior to Agent Dragojević&#39;s case.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 2: Remote exploration&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]] 
Due to the high-risk nature of the terrain within SCP-6725, remote exploration was deemed most feasible. A standard AI-integrated long-range autonomous aerial exploration vehicle equipped with an additional high-magnification camera was launched. 
**Vehicle Log**
&gt; Log begins on: 11:02 8/7/2015
&gt; **11:05**: Self-diagnostic green light 
&gt; **11:10**: Liftoff, assuming upwards course
&gt; **11:35**: Maximum flight speed attained
&gt; **14:15**: Stone ruins noted, probable building foundations. Architecture is typical of the oldest buildings from Hrigovo, probably from the 12^^th^^ century.
&gt; **16:12**: More elaborate stone village noted, in a somewhat lesser state of decay. The architectural style has begun to diverge from that typical to Hrigovo. Ruins dated to the middle of the 13^^th^^ century.
&gt; **16:15**: Ruined fortifications and ramparts observed
&gt; **18:47**: Further ruins observed, dated to the 15^^th^^ century. 
&gt; **20:47**: Further ruins observed, dated to the 17^^th^^ century. 

Following three days of further continuous flight with no observations of note, the following radio communique was received on a standard Foundation frequency, with Agent Dragojević&#39;s callsign present.

&gt; Up... [UNINTELLIGIBLE]  ...safe. The [UNINTELLIGIBLE]...
&gt; 
&gt; //Note:// The remote vehicle has moved into the reception range at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Dragojević reporting. Do you hear me? I hope you do. I am up here and I finally feel safe, for once. My feet are bloodied and my skin is burned by the sun. I starved and almost died of thirst. But up here, I am safe now. 
&gt; 
&gt; You look for me but know that you must not reveal us. Don&#39;t approach further.
&gt; 
&gt; //Note:// The autonomous vehicle AI has chosen to continue the ascent 
&gt; 
&gt; The people from Hrigovo before they came have not spent countless years climbing to escape just so you could spoil it all. The filthy look-alikes still lurk there, at the gate, and far down the rocks. As we fled from them, Branastorjević[[footnote]] Historical records indicate Branstrojević was the chief of Hrigovo sometime in the 12^^th^^ century. Legends indicate abilities consistent with those of a reality-bender [[/footnote]] did not turn the cave into salvation for it to come to this. Up here we are safe from them. They kept coming for us. At the many places where we settled, we were forced to flee and start anew. But we kept climbing and in one great leap, we came here! You won&#39;t reveal us to them now, not after all of this.
&gt; 
&gt; //Note:// Contact is lost with the autonomous craft at this point. Attempts to establish communication with Agent Dragojević&#39;s receiver by the AI were incomplete.

Simultaneously to signal reception, the following images were taken and transmitted:

[[=image Capture3.PNG size=&#34;small&#34;]]
[[=image Capture4.PNG size=&#34;small&#34;]]
[[=image Capture5.PNG size=&#34;small&#34;]]
[[=image Capture6.PNG size=&#34;small&#34;]]
[[=image Capture7.PNG size=&#34;small&#34;]]

Evaluation of the content of the received message with esoteric reverse-psychoacoustics proved inconclusive. Containment procedures were revised with the addition of monitoring equipment within SCP-6725 should the risks indicated in the message prove to be accurate. Further exploration within SCP-6725 and re-evaluation of the current stance that Hrigovo and its inhabitants are non-anomalous are pending.

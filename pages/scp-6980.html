**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the Vegas Underground incident, SCP-6980 is to be contained in a secure locker with 24 hour CCTV at site 83 in Lincoln county, Nevada. All footage is to be sent to a centralized foundation database. Testing is not to occur unless authorized by Site Director Hunter Preston.

**Description:** SCP-6980 is a Lava Lamp containing an anomalous, self-replicating wax substance that, when consumed, causes a mild euphoric effect. The substance is considered highly addictive, requiring amnestics to break addictions. The main body of the lamp has been shown to be self-repairing even if shattered completely. Other than replicating along with the wax, the water has been shown to be non-anomalous. The wax and water will only replicate to fill the main body when capped, but can replicate when it is uncapped.

**Discovery:** SCP-6980 was discovered on █/█/2002 in ██████, Mississippi after the contents of the object were consumed by 6 year old ██████ ███████. 911 was called after the child’s parents discovered him and upon receiving a description of the effects, agents implanted in the local 911 dispatch center notified the Foundation of the possibility of anomaly.

Field researcher Liliana Falana was sent to investigate the report. All parties involved were amnesticized for public safety reasons. Before this was carried out though, an interview with ██████ was conducted to better ascertain the effects of SCP-6980 (see interview log). 

After limited testing of SCP-6980, a newly promoted Dr. Falana requested the item be transferred to Site-83, where she had recently been made Site Director. Following approval, SCP-6980 was transferred to Site-83. 

Following Dr. Falana’s dismissal, SCP-6980 was placed under the supervision of Dr. Preston with the current containment procedures in place.

__**Interview Log - █/█/2002**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Field Researcher Liliana Falana

**Interviewed:** ██████ ███████

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**██████:** Am I in trouble?

**Dr. Falana:** Oh, no no no. I’m a scientist and I just want to know what happened for my research.

**██████:** You’re a scientist? That&#39;s so cool. I want to be a scientist when I grow up.

**Dr. Falana:** Well isn’t that fun. You can start right now by telling me everything that happened after you drank that lava lamp.

**██████:** Ok. I was practicing my illusion routine when I bumped into my dresser and the lava lamp my dad got me for my birthday fell over. I was always curious what it would taste like, so I ate some of the yellow stuff and I started to feel weird. Then I woke up at the hospital.

**Dr. Falana:** Hmm. Did you see any weird colors?

**██████:** Yeah and all the shapes in my room got all mixed up. I tried to stop my teddy bear from mixing with my airplane, but then I fell asleep.

**Dr. Falana:** Well, thank you for talking with me. Now go take that pill from the nice man over there. It’ll make sure the wax doesn’t do anything bad to your body.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Note:** Following the interview, ██████ ███████ was given amnestics.

**Note from O5-6:** it’s best if we don’t tell Dr. Preston he&#39;s the kid who drank the lamp. He’s a talented guy and telling him would just create unnecessary bureaucratic problems.

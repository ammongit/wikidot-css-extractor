+ Personnel File: Dr. ███████ Pogan

{{Hello, and thank you for contacting the offices of Pogan and Sons. We&#39;re sorry we&#39;re unable to respond at the moment, but if you leave a detailed message with your name and phone number, we&#39;ll get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you.}}

//Pogan, quit it with the law office bullshit. The field operation is over. Come back, man. You&#39;ve been gone for 36 days. Are you okay? And for Christ&#39;s sake, wear some goddamn normal clothes for once in your life.// - Kelly

//To be fair, I don&#39;t particularly care if he comes back. This is some funny stuff.// - Martin

//Hey hey, Pogan! It&#39;s your boy, Carl OG! Just checking in to make sure you&#39;re okay, brother. You gotta let that wack shit just fly right by you, you feel me dog? Anyway, hope you&#39;re doing okay. Say hello to your mother for me. You know she got that fat-ass, ya feel me? Haha! By the way, I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I went ahead and ate the sandwich you left in the employee lounge fridge. Figured you wouldn&#39;t need it, my man. Cheers though, brother! Save me the roach!// - &#34;Carl OG&#34; (assumed to be a false name, actual identity unknown)

//Once, when I was a small child, I was spending the day with my father. I don&#39;t remember what lead to this action, but in a fit of jubilant glee, my father ripped my nose right off my face, holding it high above his head in full display! It was the most horrified I&#39;ve ever been in all my existence! His power was clearly not to be trifled with. He saw how it affected me and had mercy, immediately popping my nose right back onto my face without any effort. I grasped at my face, thinking I was left horribly disfigured. Lo and behold, through some miracle of great sorcery, I was fine, not even a mark. We never spoke of &#34;the incident&#34; again, but in my near 40 years of existence, I&#39;ve never encountered such a vulgar display of power. I hope I never will again.// - Roger

//You guys are ridiculous. Vandalism is fucking childish.// - &#34;The Vandal&#34;

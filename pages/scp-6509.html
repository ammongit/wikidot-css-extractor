**Item #:** SCP-6509

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6509 is kept in Containment Locker 24 at Site-21 when not being tested. Request to gain access to the item is to be submitted to Site Command. Personnel are required to wear earmuffs when engaging in tests with SCP-6509. 

All SCP-6509-1 individuals are placed into standard humanoid containment cells, and can only be discharged from containment after the effects of SCP-6509 have worn off. Any SCP-6509-1 individuals that are civilians are to be immediately administered Class A amnestics upon being discharged.

**Description:** SCP-6509 is a 9 in tall penguin statue made out of smooth white marble. Present on the statue&#39;s back is that of a small golden hand crank.

When the crank is wound, the statue will begin playing the theme song of the character  &#34;The Penguin,&#34; entitled &#34;//March of the Penguin//,&#34; from the American TV drama series &#34;//Gotham//.&#34; Any individuals within the vicinity of the statue when the song is playing will fall into a hypnotic state where they will believe themselves to be the character of &#34;The Penguin.&#34; These individuals are to be regarded as SCP-6509-1 instances until the effects of SCP-6509 wear off.

Upon entering the hypnotic state, individuals will immediately begin to exhibit notable characteristics similar to those of &#34;The Penguin&#34; character.  These characteristics include:

* Walking with a limp, similar to the limp &#34;The Penguin&#34; has in the //Gotham// TV series.
* Becoming increasingly emotional and sensitive.
* Lashing out violently when angered.
* Expressing a large desire to wear fashionable and expensive clothing, most notably that of a black tuxedo.
* Becoming extremely flustered and nervous in nature if put into a potentially life-threatening position or scenario.
* Heightened intellect on knowledge relating to criminal activity, predominantly organized crime.

Despite the effects of SCP-6509 on SCP-6509-1 individuals not being permanent, there is no particular pattern followed to indicate as to when the effects of SCP-6509 will wear off; with the effects of some SCP-6509-1 individuals having the effects wear off in minutes, while others do not have the effects wear off for several years. It is currently unknown if the effects of SCP-6509 are capable of being permanent, seeing as the longest lasting recorded effect that SCP-6509 has had on an individual has been that of five years.

**Addendum 6509.1:** 07/11/2021 Incident

On July 11th, 2021, a mass breach of containment occurred, resulting in the escape of over half of the SCP-6509-1 individuals from Foundation custody. Notably, no other SCPs escaped, or were released from containment during the breach, causing site personnel to believe that the containment breach was a premeditated event organized exclusively by the contained SCP-6509-1 individuals.

It is unknown how the event was organized, however, seeing as security cameras and microphones present in all the SCP-6509-1 individuals chambers did not pick up any evidence regarding the breaches planning in the weeks prior to the breach taking place.

As of the current date, none of the escaped SCP-6509-1 individuals have been retrieved.

**Addendum 6509.2:** 07/18/2021 Incident

On July 18th, 2021, exactly one week following the security breach, site personnel discovered identical envelopes in all of the containment cells of the escaped SCP-6509-1 individuals. Each envelope was a faded white in color, and sported a green question mark icon drawn on them in green sharpie. Upon opening the envelopes, site personnel discovered that each envelope contained a small portion of a picture, which seems to be a map of some sort taken from an aerial view, with the exception of the envelope discovered in the first SCP-6509-1 containment cell. The envelope in this cell contained that of a handwritten letter, which has been provided below.

Greetings SCP Foundation,

I&#39;ll bet that you would like your various Penguin people back, now don&#39;t you? Well, don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll get to the whereabouts of your Penguins in a moment. But first, let me tell you a little bit about myself. The person who was able to steal so many of those precious Penguins right out from under the nose of the most secretive, well guarded organization in the world.

I don&#39;t want much. Just a little bit of power. A little bit of control. And who doesn&#39;t? But how is it fair that you, SCP Foundation, get all of the power? Why do you get to control what the public knows and doesn&#39;t know? Why do you get to control who lives and who dies? Who decided that you should have all that power?

I&#39;m going to take your power, SCP Foundation. I am going to take the control away from you. This Penguin breakout of mine was just the beginning. A statement to not only show you that you aren&#39;t as powerful as you think, but also to free my anomalous Penguin relatives, and start building my army.

And soon, you will be powerless. And I will be in charge.

Now, regarding your escaped Penguins. To find them, you need only to solve a little riddle of mine:

&#34;Reading right to left lets you understand the book.
But reading left to right might be the way if you look.
A large block of text is no fun to read.
So don&#39;t read, but search the block for where those come to bleed.
And that&#39;s where you&#39;ll find your penguins, of the anomalous kind.
But let us see if you can free them from my anomalous mind.&#34;

I look forward to speaking to you again very soon, SCP Foundation.

Sincerely,
???

Foundation personnel have as of yet to make sense of the riddle contained within the letter, along with the pieces of the picture discovered in the other envelopes.

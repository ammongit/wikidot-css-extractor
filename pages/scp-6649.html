SCP-6649

Item #: SCP-6649

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6649 must be kept in an open, spacious room, with a minimum of a 40m x 40m x 20m alloy steel cell. Due to the lack of a nervous system or organs, temperature and oxygen modulation are not required. SCP-6649‘s cell must be monitored by camera by staff personnel at all times, and under all circumstances of intervention with the creature a minimum of 3 personnel are required to enter the cell. The cell must be absent of all noise, as the creature can track the sources of vibration. Due to this fact, in event of an emergency, speakers are installed to modulate white noise.

Description: SCP-6649 appears to be a puppet, with the eyes and mouth of some sort of doll. The creature is in no way able to communicate other than clicking noises and strange, high pitched laughter and groans. It has the intelligence quotient of the average prepubescent child, and incorporates a tactic of emotional manipulation to instill fear into prey. The jaw and maxilla are littered with what appears to be sewing needles in an amorphous shape and pattern, which can extend out of the sockets of their teeth and are held together by thin thread. The creature is completely composed of skin tissue, and despite not having a digestive system, can still ingest sustenance, however it is not required to sustain life. 

The eyes of SCP-6649 are coal black plastic buttons, and the creature is extremely flexible, obtaining the ability to extend limbs by excreting and expanding skin tissue to a maximum of 5m per cm squared of surface area, with a docile size of 3m x 0.45m x 0.270m. SCP-6649 can reach speeds of 9 meters per second, and can crawl up walls and barricades with relative ease.

SCP-6649 is completely docile in most occasions. Vibration alerts the creature to its prey, however it only attacks if the prey is alone. SCP-6649 is aware of the monitoring equipment in the cell, but will still attack lone prey when being watched on digital devices. The creature has a multitude of attack strategies, varying from climbing to the ceiling to using the expansion of its limbs to its advantage in launching at and obtaining prey, however the most prominent strategy for SCP-6649 is to shatter the illumination panels designated around the cell, leaving the prey at a disadvantage. While the prey cannot see, SCP-6649 can track down them with ease, by the sound vibrations of their breathing or heartbeat. 

It will then sew buttons into the iris of the prey, masticate the prey’s neck to immobilize them by penetrating the spinal chord, and then extract the teeth. Once completed, the creature will entertain itself with the paralyzed body, and when finally tired of the specimen, will toss it to the side and return to its docile state.</textarea></pre>

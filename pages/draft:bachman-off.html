**ORDER BY O6**

SCP improvement according to SCP-1

The list of forbidden actions in Zone 14.

To review and be subject to execution IMMEDIATELY

[[/=]]
[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1

[[div class=&#34;rimg&#34;]]

[[/div]]

**Object Class:** --Explained-- --Maintaining heedfully-- --Thaumiel-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
Plantation of SCP-1 should be patrolled by A-class staff members on shift basis. Each member should be supervised by another member during this procedure also. All staff members working with object must wear mechanical gears for blocking the opening of the oral cavity more than 2-3 mm. Mr. O6 keeps key for these gears only. Any attempt to get gears off should be treated as such as assailing on SCP-1.

SCP-1 must be contained in boxes in a heat-assisted area (18-25 degrees above zero inside) during 3-4 days, until the SCP-1-A event occurence. After that (according to the Instruction) object must be emplaced to especially prepared soil. For further contain terms look at the Instruction O6-1-E/2019.

Zone 14 is proclaimed a contain territory for SCP-1 only. All anomalous objects which are not being currently used for containment or water/energy supply must be written off. All staff is duty-bound to underpin security of SCP-1.

Following actions are forbidden in Zone 14 for the purpose of successful containment of SCP-1:

&gt; **1)** Any attempts to eat SCP-1 without permission by Mr. O6 or over established limits and equally with violation of Statute about accurate consumption (punishable by reduction to D-class);

&gt; 

&gt; **2)** Strikes in work with SCP-1 or consuming it, opposition to any orders by Mr. O6, sabotage, culpable negligence, disrespectful attitude to SCP-1 and misleading slander about another antecedent duty position of Mr. O6(punishable by reduction to D-class);

&gt; 

&gt; **3)** A food intake of D-class corpses and equally assailing on higher class staff with the same purpose (punishable by reduction to D-class);

&gt; 

&gt; **4)** Any attempts to get out of Zone 14 (except planned maintenance work) and equally attempts to establish a radio-contact with non-existing «survivors»(punishable by reduction to D-class);
&gt; 

&gt; **5)** A dissemination of falsified data about “there is warm outside”, “the blizzard abates”, “all over here is a lie”, “this is just an experiment”, “Mr. O6 has grabbed the power”, “Mr. O6 is embezzling food and eats more than others”, “there are another Zones”, “the Foundation is eminently bigger”, “we have an SCP making food/ opening portals to another worlds”, “Mr. O5-13 will arrive and bring food for everyone”, “there is an emergency ration enough for 3000 people during 30 years deep inside tunnels” and so on (punishable by reduction to D-class);

&gt; 

&gt; **6)** Running, fast walk (faster than 3.5 km/h), jumping and any other energy intense action if it isn’t ruled by SCP-1 containment procedures (punishable by reduction to D-class);

&gt; 

&gt; **7)** High-turnover rate, wounds and illnesses causing ineffective use of SCP-1 (punishable by reduction to D-class);


&gt; **8)** Creating cults or religious groups (except professing a salvation by Mr. O6 leading) and equally any other opposition against existing Zone 14 community system and personally against Mr. O6, including withholding of information about such circumstances and actions (punishable by reduction to D-class).


According to Order by O6 the D-class staff isn’t provided for in Zone 14. It means that every reduced to D-class staff violator must be immediately (not later than 5 minutes after reduction for saving calories) executed by method preventing waste of body tissues and fluids (electrical shock is recommended).A body of violator should be delivered to dr. Witzleben laboratory for [DELETED].

Additional terms to Zone 14 Internal Service Regulations added by O6 for containing of SCP-1:

&gt; **1)** Safe keeping of information about object one is no matter ex nunc. Paper data --might be-- should be used as a fertilizer material for SCP-1;

&gt; 

&gt; **2)** All other expensive containing or dangerous objects should be immediately written off (exterminated) by low-cost methods (displacement to the surface out of Zone 14 is preferred). Current point doesn’t be forced on objects are binded by points 3 or 4 below;

&gt; 

&gt; **3)** Objects with below abilities should be used immediately for cultivation SCP-1 and supplying Zone 14:

&gt; 
&gt; - generation of light, warm, electricity or any other energy;
&gt; 
&gt; - generation of water or any other nutriments;
&gt; 
&gt; - ionizing radiation.

&gt; 

&gt; **4)** All edible objects should be delivered to dr. Witzleben in case of they aren’t fit for point 3; 

&gt; 

&gt; **5)** All staff members with obesigenic metabolism should be discharged from employment. All those adipose should be delivered to dr. Witzleben;

&gt; 

&gt; **6)** --Staff member appointed by Mr. O6 has to maintain radio contact with another recovered in the air survivors. Data transfer in exchange for food and all-important equipment supply is recommended. Meantime, the location of Zone 14 may be disclosed to subjects only who might deliver this food or equipment. The succeeding fate of all such arrived subjects should be dictated by Mr. O6 directly. In case of them aren’t fit for points of established terms they must be reduced to D-class with forfeiture of all stuff to the Zone 14.--—“Any other “survivors” don’t exist. This is a lie and misinformation by “O5 Witnesses” or “oldfoundationeers”, that must be purged away from all data files according to SCP-1 immediately. All offenders will be punished.” – O6; 

&gt; 

&gt; **7)** The irreparable loss of all SCP-1 will be treated as NF-K (No Food Keter) Event Scenario. Prevention of this doomsday event is the highest priority in relation to another Scenarios (go to the Classification of Special Scenarios as in force in 2018 for more details).


**Description:** SCP-1 is a [DELETED] not anomalous potato tubers (Solánum tuberósum). Preservation and accumulation of SCP-1 is the highest priority purpose at the present moment for --Zone 14-- --Foundation at all-- __Zone 14 is the Foundation and the Foundation is Zone 14__ Secure, Contain, Protect the SCP-1.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Snippets of diary by junior research worker Stepychev&#34; hide=&#34;- End&#34;]]

&gt; [[image %D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%81%20%281%29.jpg]]
&gt; 
&gt; **11.18.2018.**
&gt; 
&gt; **K-Day.**
&gt; 
&gt; It happened. I cannot mention the exact date of beginning that’s why just lets think it began today. The temperature has fallen and snow has started. As usual. But it didn’t just take one, two or three days. A snow flurry at the start, it has changed to the blizzard. And blizzard – to the snow storm. To the neverending night.



&gt; **K-Day +3.** 
&gt; 
&gt; A snowfall continues. The K-class Scenario protocol is promulgated. All ‘keters” are obliterated. I haven’t another purposes and just sit with my radioset. The air is fulfilled by cries for help, “maydays”, senseless orders by governments and sermons by religious bigots. But transmissions between pilots were the scariest thing. The snow didn’t approach at a steady pace and some planes has been captured in a white pitfall. Airports were made dead, glide slopes and radars didn’t work. No way to land or to understand where are you now. Guys from FD-1821 had connected with me. They had been trying to fly away from Seattle to somewhere near equator but had gotten turned around. They had gasoline for 9 hours of flight approximately but after 5 hours passengers had taken counsel together, bid farewell to all and asked pilots to turn down straight to the ground. They were fabulously calm. Last thing I had listen from them was an alert signal and repetitive phrase “Terrain ahead! Terrain ahead! Pull up! Pull up…”
&gt; 

&gt; **K-Day +6.**
&gt; 
&gt; The snow has ceased falling. We are almost buried in it. Two steps of technological tower have last on the surface only. Thankfully, the main part of Zone 14 is underground and buildings on the surface, remnants of Facility №12, had next to nothing windows. And there are one and half thousands of survivors in. Support deputy Obruchev is trying to launch the potato production system. He hammered out a lot of resources for it, even a pair of SCP’s. Some people help him but there are not a lot of those who wish. There is still food and there is still hope. I have listen a lot of stories about “reloading reality”-machines and opened gates to another beautiful worlds. I believe in it. I want to believe.



&gt; **K-Day +24.**
&gt; 
&gt; Our Director shot himself. Many shot themselves. Obruchev asks lasts don’t waste ammo and use ropes instead. He shuts down incinerator also for economy of fuel. Despite of fact that we have it a lot more than we need. And how does he lay out to exterminate corpses of suiciders?
&gt; 

&gt; **K-Day +45.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Food reserves are dwindling. Obruchev’s terms helped, this man has made a real good order. But our squandering first days made a mess of things. I’ve gone onto the surface. The weather was fine except -70 degree outside. I’ve found few frozen bodies near the gates with some papers in hands. There was the tail of plane afield, with Foundation aircraft number. Brought the saw and cut that papers out. There were the list of all Thaumiels and coordinates of all Zones in Northern America. Delivered papers to Obruchev. He asked what the fucking cold crap did I bring and chucked it away, ordered not to go to the surface anymore and move less at all. Dorky place.



&gt; **K-Day +67.**
&gt; 
&gt; Food is over. But there are good news too – mr. Obruchev and his friend dr. Witzleben have launched a not bad potato forage growing. Would it help us to survive until the new warming? I don’t think so. But I don’t want to die too. Nobody wants. All who wanted have hanged up themselves. We are like roaches – we will fit in and survive.


&gt; **K-Day +99.**
&gt; 
&gt; It seems like somebody has read my diary. It’s my neighbor, I’m sure. I dislike his mug long time. There are no BANANAS here, PETYA!
 

&gt; **K-Day +136.**
&gt; 
&gt; ███████ potato. I hate it. Hate to eat, hate to grow. Geez. I should have to blow out my brains before ammo were confiscated. But I’m not ready for rope. All around seems unreal. Can it be another bastardish experiment?

&gt; **K-Day +159.**
&gt; 
&gt; I have caught that bloody idiot in room fulfilled with his soul mates. They say that we need to limit the Director’s power, that Director presumes too far. I’m not a fool, he slips a cog sometimes, but he goes right way. How could we survive instead? Pyotr says that it is bad to use dead bodies. But isn’t it bad to gobble potato this way? Look how this bastard has fed his mug. I’m sure, he steals potato. What could be another reason to be volunteer for all potato works? Fucking agronomist.


&gt; **K-Day +187.**
&gt; 
&gt; There was a tea fight today. Few staffs with Andrey ahead have gone to Director. A damn new Father Gapon, really. Petya has gone there too. They brought their claims. Don’t use bodies like beasts. Improve consumption limits. Stop spreading rumors about he is O5-4. Chief made new Bloody Sunday for them. He didn’t fluff off and was ready to this. I don’t know how many they had laid out. They say two or three, but I haven’t seen again a lot more since that time. There are rumours that last trouble-makers get off deep inside into tunnels and try to make their own Zone 14 with blackjack and hookers. Temperature is falling yet. The warm temperature more or less is in potato containment zone and command-staff block only.
 

&gt; **K-Day +192.**
&gt; 
&gt; Cold. I sleep clothed in under three blankets. Something is going on with my health. The world goes dark before my eyes. There is strange after-taste in my mouth. Did the water filter get out of order?


&gt; **K-Day +193.**
&gt; 
&gt; Potato. Potatie. Potatolet.



&gt; **K-Day +200.**
&gt; 
&gt; Greater punitive measures are added for violations of SCP according to SCP-1.  Running and fast moving and other energy-wasting operations are forbidden. By the way, is diarising an energy-wasting operation? I cannot remember the moment since I am reckoning. Cannot force myself to read that has been written even a week before. Need to ask the Overseer about it. A pen is frozen. Write by pencil. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The tooth fell out right now – too little vitamins.

&gt; **K-Day +265.**
&gt; 
&gt; New orders by O5-4 are published. It is officially forbidden now to decline that he is a last survivor in Council and has O6 grade. To go to the surface and keep contact with the world outside is forbidden too. I am promoted to the position of militia chief in Zone 14. --O5-4-- O6 have run potato vodka into my glass by his own hand for capture of two depredators. I offered him to set them into cell but he answered “why should we feed them?” “Seekers” started to burrow on east direction – they decided there are deposits of carrot. O6 laughed at them after second glass. He said ”it would be OK if they dig to south-west but they want into ocean”. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The work with paper archives is almost finished and them are prepared to use for fertilization SCP-1 (it is Thaumiel now, by the way). Reading was forbidden but I had looked through a pair. What a junk they kept here before!



&gt; **K-Day +301.**
&gt; 
&gt; Damn bastards. They are bitches, aren’t they? If you don’t like O6 – just sit calm in your fucking  tunnels! Don’t play these shitty dirty tricks with us! No, grabbing of SCP-1 plantations and gobbling meals prepared by others is not enough for you now! You need to break it too! Dorks. New order by O6 directs to --kill-- reduce all violators to D-class and send to dr. Witzleben. We do it already by the way but O6 decided to make it a rule as indispensable measure. 
&gt; 
&gt; Teeth have fallen out almost everyone. Hurry up, let it be every, please. These nagging pain and bleeding pus are awful. O5 gave me overdenture from health center as a merit. Others need to gnaw SCP-1 by last teeth or to suck it round. It’s strange but O6 have almost all his teeth intact.

&gt; **K-Day +445.**
&gt; 
&gt; We have yield decrease. And it is despite of radical declining number of eaters. Foes of SCP-1 are watchful. It emerged that dr. Povyshev is enemy too. The Povyshev! He was O5, the right hand of O6! I have seen by my own eyes he bunged SCP-1 to the wall. He calmed down and licked it off after of course but this is inexcusable. I turned this bastard over – new work for Witzleben. 
&gt; 
&gt; Strange scrawls began to appear all over the bunker. Red letters “O5 see”. Main corridors became covered with ice. All pencils are confiscated. I’m writing by piece of coal.


&gt; **K-Day +460.**
&gt; 
&gt; One of bigots exploded himself trying to kill High Overseer. Things are heating up. O6 called for me and set a task that could give me O5 rank and position of personal bodyguard. I need to feign my opposition to regime and escape. I will be reduced to D-class for the most cogency and Witzleben will let me to run away. I should to wriggle into favour to underground bands. Especially to “O5 Witnesses”. These bigots proclaim that all over was another some time ago. That there is a Foundation out of Zone 14. I don’t know how could I agree with all this stupid crap but I should to accomplish the mission. We drank a pair of glasses and went away.

&gt; **K-Day +461.**
&gt; 
&gt; I was convinced in swallowing of SCP-1 without jawing and sent to Witzleben. He shook my hand (despite of it is forbidden) and wished a fair yield. I got to the lowest level by air channel and headed for tunnels. With two potatoes in reserve.

&gt; **K-Day +464.**
&gt; 
&gt; I am wandering here few short potato cycles. Nobody’s here. No power to cry.
&gt; 
&gt; Could it be deception? Witzleben? Kutukov? Sarychev? All these bastards wanted to become O5. They pitched a line O6, drew  all over walls, cranked out “O5 Witnesses” and ”oldfoundationeers” from muck for mugs... But O6 is almost alone there! I need to find out the way back immediately and pull him through these Colorado beetles.

&gt; **K-Day +465.**
&gt; 
&gt; They have found me. “Oldfoundationeers”. I live among them. Almost cannot write – it looks too suspiciously. Andrey is here by the way, alive and healthy. If it could be said about a man with all bones stick out a mile.
 
&gt; **K-Day +483.**
&gt; 
&gt; They have opened my eyes. I have read extant archives. They amazed how I save ability to read and write as distinct from others. They have papers for days but too scantily light. As it happens the world is too bigger than I imagined before.  There are many Zones, the Foundation is colossal, it is being ruled by O5 Council, a group of powerful men at the top of. And our so cold O6 is just a little usurper who bought all of us for a sack of SCP-1. Food needs, desires to make rank and take place in the ultraviolet lamp had disorientated us. Disorientated. A complicated word that I was using some time ago. There was something like a clarification of thoughts. I began to remember. Did he drugged something to us? I bet dollars to donuts, yes, because all amnesiacs and other mixtures had been wasted somehow. It must be finished. I discovered myself to them. I have told all what I know and have got ready for --reduction to D-class-- to death. But they didn’t kill me. They said I am Chosen one and it is my destiny to start the revolution.
 
&gt; **K-Day +484.**
&gt; 
&gt; They had only one assault rifle and gave it to me. Others were armed pretty various – clubs, bricks, pipes… there were 7 pistols too, but not enough ammo. Andrey goes ahead with drum. We will overthrow this regime and build a brave new world. A world where nobody should be --reduced to D-class-- killed for jawing 18 times instead 36 times as it is ordered.  A world where bodies of died people may be buried in the frozen wastelands humanly. A world where is no lie about small and poor Foundation. A world where rulers don’t steal and waste SCP-1 to product vodka. A world without O6.

&gt; **K-Day +491.**
&gt; 
&gt; An NF-K Event happened. As a hoc tempore of O6 position I order to everyone to go to surface and reduce yourself to D-class. This order should be rip-and-read also to all who can’t read independently.

&gt; **K-Day +1.**
&gt;  
&gt; All have gone out. I am shilly-shally yet. Got dress O6 aglet, dumped papers according to SCP-1. I shall finish this text and hide the diary to the safe box. A have read all my notes but remembered too little. Who was I, how all these things had happened. Strange voices from the past sound in my head, that I cannot remember. Well, I should go.

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Euclid

**Containment Procedures:** --Subject is to be kept in a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m concrete room with 35 cm thick walls, reinforced with iron and titanium alloys. Subject is not allowed out of the cell for any reason due to its hostility.-- 
 --Subject is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell furnished with standard furniture and objects. The subject is allowed an hour to walk around the facility, as long as it’s accompanied by no less than two (2) armed security personnel-- 
 Subject is contained in a 10 m x 15 m x 15 m Grow Room in Site-██ with an assortment of bushes, shrubs, ferns and trees. At least one tree should be large enough for the subject to climb and sleep in. The room’s misters must be routinely checked every week for damage and in the event of repairs being necessary for the pipes, SCP-6105 is to be temporarily relocated to an empty room until the pipes are repaired. 
Subject is allowed to roam freely around the facility, accompanied by no less than one (1)  security personnel. 

In the event of another SCP breaching containment, SCP-6105 is to be allowed to track down and pursue the subject in question. 
 
**Description:** SCP-6105 appears to be a caucasian male in its late teens, 170 cm (5 ft. 7 in.) in height and 57 kg, with brown hair and green eyes as it’s **Base Form.** However, subject is capable of changing its appearance, from hair or eye color to his height, weight and body type at will. It can even change its appearance to look like personnel. 

SCP-6105-B is a small, green obsidian crystal roughly the size of a baseball. SCP-6105-B appears if/when SCP-6105 takes enough damage to be reduced to dust, dropping amid the dust pile and flashing green once. 
SCP-6105 can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to come back. When the subject reforms, SCP-6105-B flashes brightly, and SCP-6105 appears in SCP-6105-B’s place.

Subject was found in the forest a few miles from Site-█, after Mobile Task Force Tau-5 went to investigate the source of an electromagnetic disturbance that had temporarily disabled long range communications. Tau-5, two other security squads, and a group of D-Class personnel went to investigate. The D-Class personnel were equipped with body cameras and mics, and two were assigned to each security squad. After an hour of searching SCP-6105 was found in the tree tops, by Squadron 3-A. They went dark ten minutes before the subject ran into MTF Tau-5. After another two hours, the subject was subdued and detained.

After a few weeks, SCP-6105 was able to communicate with staff and other personnel, although being around D-Class personnel makes it uneasy. Subject is harmless towards staff and security personnel, and has even offered to teach security officers some forms of hand-to-hand combat. SCP-6105, originally was a Keter class subject, but due to recent developments SCP-6105 is now an Euclid class subject.

SCP-6105 is a part of a security task force designated “Green Arrow” and is the instant response team tasked with taking care of containment breaches. 

The O5 considered to create the force after SCP-6105 encountered [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 |SCP-682]]] during the SCP’s containment breach. SCP-6105 was nearly flattened by SCP-682 but SCP-6105 seemed to have a similar effect on SCP-682 as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999 |SCP-999]]] did, being able to cause the dangerous beast to slow down. Eventually SCP-682 collapsed, passed out from an unknown reason, that was later discovered to be a sedative powerful enough to knock out a whale. 

”Yeah, I can manipulate and create poisons from thin air, like my arrows. They’re more complex and take a lot out of me, but its useful.” -SCP-6105 when questioned about the incident

**Record of Squadron 3-A’s Comms**

&gt; &lt;LT. Durson&gt; This is Squadron 3-A, approaching sector C-8. Scanning for the entity. 
&gt; &lt;Pvt. Kyle&gt; Our six is clear. 
&gt; &lt;Command&gt; Affirmative Squad 3-A. Remember to watch the trees. 
&gt; &lt;Srgt. Bishop&gt; Copy that, scanning above. 
&gt; &lt;Pvt. Kyle&gt; Wait, what’s that?
&gt; &lt;Command&gt; Do not engage the subject. 
&gt; &lt;Pvt. Kyle&gt; It&#39;s coming towards us!
&gt; &lt;There is the sound of Gunfire.&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Srgt. Bishop&gt; Shit he&#39;s armed! Subject is armed!
&gt; &lt;There is the sound of more gunfire followed by a scream.&gt;
&gt; &lt;Lt. Durson&gt; Pvt. Kyle is down! I repeat Kyle is- 
&gt; &lt;Lt. Durson is cut off, then there is more gunfire.&gt;
&gt; &lt;Srgt. Bishop&gt; The subject is armed and hostile. Command, what are your orders?
&gt; &lt;Command&gt; Retreat to Tau-5. They’re set up south of your position and ready to subdue the subject. Do not engage further.
&gt; &lt;Srgt. Bishop doesn&#39;t respond immediately.&gt;
&gt; &lt;Srgt. Bishop began to speak but was cut off. Then there is the sound of something hitting the ground.&gt;
&gt; &lt;After several attempts from command to reach Squad 3-A, they were determined KIA&gt;

**Foreword:** Document of a session between the subject and SCP-6105 a few months after SCP-6105 was obtained. 

**&lt;Begin Log, 0900&gt;**

**Dr. Petra:** Hello. I hear you like to be called Risk? 

**SCP-6105:** Uh, yeah. Preferably. If I see someone outside who calls me SCP-6105 I wont be as offended, just try to at least pretend I’m real. 

**Dr. Petra:** Very well. We’re going to refer to you as Risk in this interview. At least by name between us.

**SCP-6105:** That’s ok. What would you like to talk about, Doctor.

**Dr. Petra:** How did you know I was a doctor?

**SCP-6105:** Well I assumed everyone who was going to come talk to me was an expert of some kind, and I thought it would be flattering to refer to them as ‘Doctor.’ If i was wrong they would be happy. If I was right, I&#39;d see if they had big egos or not.

**Dr. Petra:** Ah. I have to admit that would work. All of the personnel with Level 2 clearance or above are doctors, except security personnel.

**SCP-6105:** Excellent.

**Dr. Petra:** Now, you had mentioned before that you were from another universe?

**SCP-6105:** Yeah. I was actually like the guardian of it. One of three. Our job was simply to keep powerful threats from trying to destroy it. I was also part of the enforcement part of the world, taking out tainted souls.

**Dr. Petra:** When you say tainted souls, what do you mean?

**SCP-6105:** People like the D-Class personnel who committed serious crimes like murder, or even worse ones like kidnapping or rape. 

**Dr. Petra:** kidnapping is worse than murder there?

**SCP-6105:** I would argue it’s worse in any conceptualization of the word except in universes where kidnapping is good. I&#39;d rather die than have the trauma of being helpless and reliant on other people. 

**Dr. Petra:** Interesting. You fear being helpless?

**SCP-6105:** Yeah. Anyways I also fear not ever dying. 

**Dr. Petra:** Well I would think not dying would be incredible. You could experience everything without being stressed. 

**SCP-6105:** You could never be more wrong. Granted it&#39;s not immortality since I could still die of old age, theoretically. But I still feel the pain of death, and feel that pain for a while. And if I am immortal, that would mean that anyone I fell in love with would die old while I continued to live on without them. 
I mean, when God marked Cain and made him eternally immortal, that was a worse punishment than death. Because he would still be alive to this day, probably after falling in love numerous times only to leave said love behind as they died and he didn&#39;t….


&lt;SCP-6105 leans on it’s arms and puts its face in its hands, sighing&gt;

**Dr. Petra:** I can see how that would be torture. Let&#39;s go ahead and end the session for today. 

**SCP-6105:** Ok. Nice talking to you Doctor

**&lt;End Log, 1030&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** //Dr. Petra left SCP-6105 alone as the subject began throwing knives at a tree.//

__**Test A -04-27-2020**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Subject:** D-0356, D-1066

**Procedure:** Subjects would be put in SCP-6105 containment chamber and left there as SCP-6105 shows personnel its abilities. 

**Results:** 
D-0356- ELIMINATED BY SCP-6105. 
D-1066- ELIMINATED BY SCP-6105. 

SCP-6105 revealed it can summon arrows out of thin air and send them flying as if fired from a bow. The arrows are green and emit a dim light, but are otherwise no different from hunting arrows. SCP-6105 can also conjure Kunai, japanese throwing knives, in its hands. 

**Analysis:** SCP-6105 is possibly one of the most dangerous entities in the Foundation’s custody. However, due to the entity’s cooperation and apparent respect for staff, SCP-6105 remains cooperative.

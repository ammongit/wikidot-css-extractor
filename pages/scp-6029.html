**Item #:** SCP-6029

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6029 is to be kept in a normal object containment chamber, which can only be accessed for research. A trained psychologist takes a mental exam from the D-class test subject, before contact with SCP-6029. Afterward, the test subject will be isolated for at least 12 hours under supervision by a guard and is only to be returned to his cell after a mental exam taken by a trained psychologist confirms the psychosis caused by SCP-6029 has ended.

**Description:** SCP-6029 appears as an 1840 wooden victorian bed. The bed frame has a curly engraving on the front. No unusual features can be noticed visually.

Subjects within range of SCP-6029&#39;s aura (approximately 5m, 15f) will experience a strong urge to sleep in the bed and claim to have become really tired. Although the subjects are tired within proximity of the bed, none have fallen asleep outside of the bed, even after another normal bed was offered to sleep in within SCP-6029&#39;s aura. Meaning the tiredness emitted is only used to lure targets towards the bed.

SCP-6029&#39;s real properties are noticeable after subjects who have slept in it for 2h - 3h, suddenly wake up and enter a psychosis resembling their dreams. Subjects under influence of SCP-6029 are completely lucid and able to move freely, but the surroundings they roam are disguised as their current dream. Research has shown SCP-6029 influences sight, hearing, smell, touch, and pain, where stimuli to the body can affect the dream of the subject. They also seem to have increased emotional activity, which is shaped by their dreams&#39; ambiance. Subjects having nightmares either become really scared, running around in the research chamber. Or really aggressive, even attempting to attack an on-duty guard, for them disguised as a possible threat.

The psychosis ends after 2 - 12 hours according to the tiredness of the active subject. Attempts to awaken the subject undergoing a psychosis have failed, seeming the only way for them to wake up is to wait for their natural awakening. After waking up, test subjects can easily describe what they dreamt about as if it was an event occurring previously in their conscious state.


**Addendum 6029-1:** A D-Class subject undergoing a nightmare-psychosis, purposefully created by psychologists for further research on SCP-6029, suddenly started running, screaming loudly, and finally fell onto the ground. After further investigation of the body, the subject was declared dead, and lethal scratch marks could be seen on the back of the subject. Further research and testing with nightmare psychoses, has shown that entities appearing in dreams are able to harm the body of the subject undergoing the psychosis. After these findings, research with SCP-6029 can only be done with admission from 2 tier 3 scientists.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the extremely benign nature of SCP-6207, and a lack of plausible containment methods, containment has been deemed unnecessary.

**Description:** SCP-6207 is a phenomenon that affects peoples with late-stage neurodegenerative diseases (generally Alzheimer’s and Dementia) who are undergoing terminal lucidity. During an SCP-6207-Event, a seemingly invisible entity appears to SCP-6207-1 subjects. The physical descriptions of SCP-6207-A varies heavily between SCP-6207-1, with the most vivid description being “all my memories, bundled into one object”.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Virginia Fuller
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Howard Fuller
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Researcher Howard Fuller records his mother Virginia Fuller (aged 83), after having recently been affected by SCP-6207-A. Recording begins abruptly, without Virginia noticing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 10/13/2005
------
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** -and can you say what you saw again mom?
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** I saw…my whole life. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** Describe it for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** It…my…everything it physically walked up to me. Every sight, every taste, I-I can vividly see Knut with me-at the uh- altar, yes in ████. God, it was so hot, I was melting in that damned dress.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** Go on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** As much as I hated the heat…It was beautiful. The apple trees were blossoming-the ones behind the old church me and Knut went to. Y’know the old Lutheran one-it was uhm-it was south of town a ways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** Is that all you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** Oh, no, no! Of course not, just one minute-uh…god it&#39;s all rushing back, makes it hard to think.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** Take your time, no rush.
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** Yeah, I suppose…I do remember the day you were born Howard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** [//Chuckles//] I’d hope.
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** Oh don’t. You gave me hell that day-it was-was uhm…-18 hours you took to get out. Still-after all of that, I raised you. And I still love you to this day Howard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** I…I love you too mom.
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** Let me think up more stories…I-I remember when I was young-my mother would grow these beautiful crocuses on-uhm-the dining room windowsill. They smelt like…candy? Very subtle smell, but indescribably magnificent. Maybe I’ll grow some in the future, the house could use some color.
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** Finish telling your story mom…
&gt; 
&gt; **Virginia:** Ah-yes, right. Well these flower pots she kept them in, very unsteady, so we were never supposed to play in the dining room, well- we did. Coincidentally on a day where the window was open to let the breeze in- we blamed the dog. I-I don’t know why I remember that story specifically but, I remember, I…//I really do remember//…
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** …
&gt; 
&gt; **Howard:** …mom?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Virginia Fuller passed away either during or after the recording ended. Howard Fuller would share the recording with the Foundation on the basis of furthering research involving SCP-6207.

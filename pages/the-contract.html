Mr. Benson handed me the final page of the contract. 
“Only one more signature left, and you are officially on the job!”
“Done.”
“Welcome to Alstom! Let me get my stapler, so I can file this properly.”
As Mr. Benson turned toward his cabinet, I noticed the fine print: “Your body and soul will be the property of Epimetheus Labs Inc. for a maximum duration of 2 hours, effective immediately after signature of the present contract”. 
“Hey, Mister Benson, what does this...”

I was no longer in Mr. Benson’s office, but in a room of raw concrete walls and ceiling, the size of a football field. It was empty, except for a desk covered by what seemed like random items: a hard hat, a brick, a pair of scissors, nails... There also was a logo stretching from floor to ceiling on one of the walls, an arrow and a lightning bolt forming a cross. 
A few seconds after my arrival, I heard an ear-splitting rattling noise behind me. The only entrance to the room, a massive blast door, was opening. Two guys in lab coats entered, followed by two armed guards. One of the white coats was carrying a suitcase. He pulled out of it what looked like the fusion between a rifle and a satellite dish. After fiddling with it for a few seconds, he gave a thumbs-up and announced &#34;He&#39;s fit for service&#34;. The other one started talking:
“Hello Mr. Harker. I’m Doctor Rachov, and here is Doctor Borgski. We don’t have a lot of time, so you will simply listen carefully to what I say, and do everything as you are told. It will be way more pleasant, for both of us.”
“What am I doing here? Where am I?”
“And already, he is not listening! When I say we don’t have a lot of time, that implies no time for questions.”
“But…”
I felt Rachov’s stone cold gaze. I looked at the impassible faces of Borgski and the gun wielding bodyguards. They had done this a thousand times, it was their job. And there was no place for empathy in it. I was better off listening to Rachov.
“Ok, I’m sorry. Tell me what you want me to do.”
He ordered me to wear the hard hat from the desk. I had just finished adjusting it when, out of the blue, he threw a pen right at my face. But I wasn’t hit, instead the pen bounced back just a few centimeters from my head, like it had hit an invisible wall. Borgski started writing on a notepad holder. Rachov asked me to step back a few meters and stand still. He then threw the brick at me, and the same thing happened. However, when he threw the scissors, they stopped only a few millimeters from my left eye, way too close for comfort. 
Dr. Rachov seemed to be quite annoyed by that. Unexpectedly, he drew a handgun from his back pocket and shot me in the shoulder. 
He sighed: “No pain, I presume?” 
I stammered: “Why… why did you do this?”
“Are you in pain, or not?”
“N...no, no I didn’t feel anything”
“It’s always the same thing, they fix one issue, and they create another! Take note Borgski, that the charm division should learn to follow the instructions I give them properly. Look at that useless piece of crap! This is supposed to be a serious project god damn it! ” 
I cleared my throat to attract his attention. He glowered at me.
“Yes?” 
I mumbled: “What about… the bullet?”
“Oh, of course. The bullet.”
He picked up a black cylinder ending with a suction cup from the suitcase, and pressed it on my shoulder for a few seconds. When I looked back at it, my wound had disappeared.
Dr. Rachov regained his composure.
“Well, all we can do for now is postpone testing. Looks like this was a waste time for both of us.” He grabbed Borgski’s notepad holder and began reading: “You will be compensated for your contribution to project 567-C, as mentioned in article 6 item 15,  any wounds sustained during testing are eligible for additional compensation...blah, blah, blah… just sign here.”

I had just finished the last stroke of my autograph when I found myself back in Mr. Benson’s office. I checked the clock: 5 past 11. Not a minute had passed since I left. What had just happened? A hallucination? A dream? I looked at my shoulder: the bullet hole and the blood were still there on my shirt. Not a dream, then. But still, the line about Epimetheus Labs wasn’t on the contract anymore.
“Mr. Benson, did you notice anything... weird? Do you know Epimetheus Labs?” 
“What? Oh my god, you are bleeding!”
“Hum... Yeah. Yeah I&#39;m bleeding. I... I will head out and take care of this.”

After leaving the office, I noticed the envelope in my pocket. It was marked with the same logo I had seen on the wall of the “Lab”. Inside was a 20€ banknote. The absolute cheapskates. That’s barely enough to buy a new shirt.</textarea></pre>

Object: SCP-6036
Object Class: Euclid

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-6036-A and SCP-6036-B are to be contained in a three (3) room cell furnished with basic furniture and items, as well as a bathroom. Subjects are not allowed out of their cell at any time for any reason.
So far these three points keep the subjects in their cell
*SCP-6036-A and SCP-6036-B do not seem to want to be separated from each other. 
*SCP-6036-B seems to follow SCP-6036-A&#39;s lead, never doing anything without her say-so
*SCP-6036-A never leaves the darker part of the rooms its is in. Otherwise it doesn&#39;t move. 

**Description:** Both subjects have the same facial features, brown hair, a weight of 25 kg (55 lbs), and a height of 0.76. The difference between the two is almost impossible to notice from a distance, but its obvious when you see them up close. 
SCP-6036-A has black eyes that cause any room its in to become dim, no matter how brightly lit the room is. It also has black tattoos on its upper arms that resemble wings. 
SCP-6036-B has white eyes that seem to enhance the lights of any room the subject is in. Sometimes this can cause rooms to become so bright that they can temporarily blind anyone inside. Subject has similar tattoos as SCP-6036-A, only grey instead of black. 

SCP-6036-A is referred to as “Bro” by SCP-6036-B. It’s anomalous ability is unknown at the time of the writing of this file, as the subject was always trying to remain in the darkest parts of any room it was in and refrain from contact with any personnel. 

SCP-6036-B, which is referred to as “Sis” by SCP-6036-A, showed its anomalous abilities almost as soon as it awoke from the sedatives used to transport it to the site. The first thing it did was summon two blades of pure light which it used to destroy the door of the cell. However, SCP-6036-A refused to move, which seemed to deter SCP-6036-B from leaving. 
SCP-6036-B’s second anomalous ability is using light to vanish from thin air, effectively turning invisible. As with when the subject destroyed the door. SCP-6036-B seemed unable to leave SCP-6036-A behind. 

After a few days in containment, SCP-6036-B ceased to escape containment, while SCP-6036-A began to walk around a little. Eventually the subjects were relocated to a more comfortable cell with separate bedrooms and a bathroom, as well as basic furniture. Upon their relocation, the subject became more docile. 

**Notes:** SCP-6036-A appears to represent the still, calm darkness of the world, while SCP-6036-B represents the ever-present and chaotic light. Not much is known about these entities, as they are a more recent acquisition and haven’t been subjected to any experiments as of yet.</textarea></pre>

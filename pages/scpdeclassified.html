[https://redd.it/at3uoj SCP-173 - The Sculpture - The Original]
&gt; //It was written to convey a setting, a world in which the abnormal is not only reality, but commonplace. The actual object was just a narrative vehicle for that.//

[https://redd.it/6rwzcq SCP-184 - The Architect]
&gt; //The Administrator then asks the question again. What is the best way to hide SCP-001, the maker of the universe?//
&gt;
&gt; //Make it SCP-184.//

[https://redd.it/6cgl2o SCP-256 - Trapped in the Typewriter]

&gt; //Why sex offender, all of the sudden? Does this have a hidden meaning? (Of course it does, that&#39;s why I mentioned it.)//

[https://redd.it/71vz8e SCP-1173 - The Islamic Republic of Eastern Samothrace]
&gt; //The other side claims that the memetic agent removes the memory that this country exists, that it is an actual place, and that the people from this country are experiencing severe persecution, bordering on genocide, due to the memetic agent preventing the world from acknowledging that they exist.//
&gt;
&gt; //And we have no way of knowing which is true.//

[https://redd.it/6y27ab SCP-1272 - Slow Motion Catastrophe]
&gt; //Mr. Blue Man is moving at over 400 million kilometers per hour. This is why they&#39;ve been sending teams in to stop the first group. If the first teams move the statues and stop the anomaly, Mr. Blue Man will still be moving that fast when he leaves.//

[https://redd.it/anazm0 SCP-1342 - To the Makers of Music]

&gt; //The ideas are leaking.//

[https://redd.it/6pb48p SCP-1425 - Star Signals]
&gt; //So either the authors of Star Signals are uneducated wackos, or they’re talking about other anomalous weirdness. Either works.//

[https://redd.it/6iouvm SCP-1427 - Extinguishing Stele]
&gt; //And in order to keep a constant supply of oppressed people, the Foundation engages in propping up the government of North Korea in order to keep the regime running.//

[https://redd.it/6ykmmg SCP-1539 - Semantic Dissociator]
&gt; //Obviously, this is a washer/dryer set. We even know its model number. Yes, it moved around, spoke, and had the physical attributes of a man (and now it has the attributes of a dead and decaying man.) How does that change that it&#39;s a washer/dryer set?//

[https://redd.it/6oar7k SCP-1564 - Post-Nibbanic]
&gt; //Here, the author is saying &#34;God, I wish there were some magical device that could block these telepathic signals! Too bad that doesn&#39;t exist&#34;.//

[https://redd.it/6t8es3 SCP-1718 - Experimental Containment Unit]

[https://redd.it/6cgl7j SCP-1730 - What Happened to Site-13? Part I]
&gt; //The basic setup that you should be aware of: a Site from another universe kicked into our reality, from a parallel Foundation that is less ethical than ours. This idea is explored in great detail.//

[https://redd.it/8p5brb SCP-1730 - What Happened to Site-13? Part II]
&gt; //If there&#39;s something strange in your neighborhood,//

&gt; //They also have their own undercover janitors scouring the Foundation&#39;s halls for invisible graffiti (I wonder if there even are any Foundation janitors that are just janitors).//

**[https://redd.it/acmiyk SCP-2122 - The Black Hole]**
&gt; //Now imagine an army of soldiers with advanced weaponry, all enhanced by SCP-2122-2. That is the Foundation&#39;s goal here.//

**[https://redd.it/7tm4jc SCP-2123 - I Accidentally The Whole Universe]**
&gt; //There are a lot of eithers here in this article. Here, either this collider collides particles currently unknown to mankind, or knowing which particles are collided is somehow dangerous information.//

**[https://redd.it/a8lyg9 SCP-2140 - Retroconverter]**
&gt; //That&#39;s where the Ethics Committee steps in. Messing with people&#39;s personal history isn&#39;t a moral thing to do.//

**[https://redd.it/a5tvu7 SCP-2180 - The Living Cave Painting]**
&gt; //Stroke of midnight. 1st January. The new year. This is what the number is on the wall.//

&gt; //On another note, why the hell would a toymaker create this damn thing?//

**[https://redd.it/7xzp80 SCP-2316 - Field Trip]**
&gt; //The &#39;cognitohazard&#39; is simply the bodies of a dead class of young students trying to make the world remember them.//

**[https://redd.it/6d3weh SCP-2317 - A Door To Another World]**
&gt; //The real twist is that SCP-2317 isn&#39;t the door, but the entity contained within: &#34;The ████, Devourer of Worlds&#34;. We also learn that Calabasas is - get this - useless. It doesn&#39;t do anything.//
&gt;
&gt; //SCP-2317 is uncontainable.//

**[https://redd.it/7inrmw SCP-2338 - Unorthodox Adoption]**
&gt; //Yes, this weird large jellyfish thing somehow has a connection to two grown men breaking into a maximum security vault and killing 22 children. Yes. Welcome to the Foundation, reader.//

**[https://redd.it/7fj5ul SCP-2357 - The Perfect SCP]**
&gt; //Ultimately, this is a character piece. Dr. Graff was irresponsible and put a lot of people in danger with her actions. She is clearly very intelligent, but is petulant and petty, and when she was insulted, she struck back with overwhelming force.//

**[https://redd.it/7iovqu SCP-2400 - Temporal Dilation Facility]**
&gt; //Of course, 2400 would be consumed, and everyone inside would die, but at least everyone outside would be fine. Probably.//

**[https://redd.it/6polfa SCP-2456 - Dreams of a Broken World]**
&gt; //While active, there were random eclipses, zombies, and red poison in the sea. It also killed 53 million people.//

**[https://redd.it/a2d4sk SCP-2470 - The Void Singularity]**
&gt; //Since this object is comparatively easy to contain, it makes little sense to try and destroy it and allow another ZK-class scenario to form. This thing is a goddamn insurance policy.//

**[https://redd.it/6mdnxw SCP-2480 - An Unfinished Ritual]**
&gt; //&#34;Presumed Neutralized&#34;? Well, isn&#39;t that comforting. What that essentially means is://
&gt; //Object Class: --It&#39;s fine-- --NO IT ISN&#39;T-- It&#39;s gone missing.//

**[https://redd.it/7ogsng SCP-2498 - The Rainbow Body]**
&gt; //SCP-2498 is an epic of impressive scale, a narrative about godhood, humanity, and the weight of the world and of the flow of time.//

**[https://redd.it/6msvv2 SCP-2510 - Our Broken Salvation]**
&gt; //The Broken God given us hope. And all we have to do is accept Him as our God, fight back, rebel against the Flesh.//

&gt; //And thus, both the end of the universe and the beginning of it are one and the same, this endless bright corridor, the only thing we know is real.//

**[https://redd.it/8dtmc9 SCP-2678 - The Vorehole]**
&gt; //Let&#39;s jump in, literally and metaphorically.//

**[https://redd.it/6xhacb SCP-2700 - Teleforce]**
&gt; //Worse, it seems that the core is containing Omega, and if that containment were ever to break, the reversed entropy would spread across the entire universe, reversing time back to the Big Bang. It&#39;s set to do just that, breaking its own containment in 2234.//

**[https://redd.it/6mnff4 SCP-2718 - What Happens After]**
&gt; //And what the everloving FUCK is &#34;DAMMERUNG&#34;?//

**[https://redd.it/6i9gsl SCP-2719 - Inside]**
&gt; //Someone tries to make intestinal distress Inside Dr. Bright, but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work. The pointer tries to access the location in memory of Intestinal Distress; it&#39;s Outside, and no longer under the pointer&#39;s influence. Whatever the case, Dr. Bright assigns the pointer to Intestinal Distress, puts the doctor Inside it.//

**[https://redd.it/7h14jz SCP-2740 - It Wasn&#39;t There]**
&gt; //This SCP can&#39;t really be understood in-universe, and that&#39;s kind of the point. That nightmare most of us have had: running from something, some unknowable fear, the one Olivia references? This is that bundled with family tragedy and domestic violence.//

**[https://redd.it/7hd2uf SCP-2747 - As below, so above]**
&gt; //Hell, by studying the anafabula so heavily, the Foundation has accelerated its own destruction by giving it so many opportunities to enter their universe, and by creating one in the layer just beneath them.//

**[https://redd.it/77apj4 SCP-2764 - The Eldritch Antarctic]**
&gt; //He’s being followed by an eldritch horror and mentally tormented by it at the same time, but he pitches a fucking tent and reads a book.//

&gt; //The next one is attempting to destroy SCP-001. First, it&#39;s approved, only to be rejected due to being &#34;Impossible.&#34; This is where we get the sense that this is a big issue.//

**[https://redd.it/7c3sjo SCP-2905 - A Web Wrapped With Roses and Poisons]**
&gt; //And sadly, the plan of keeping her safe by building her a human body is completely ruined by the Foundation’s existence. The moment the body is finished and she’s able to move with it, the Foundation will either destroy her or lock her up in a dark cell for all time.//

**[https://redd.it/7mok5s SCP-2922 - Notes From the Under]**
&gt; //In conclusion this skip isn’t just about a shitty little brain implant, it’s about love, betrayal, and doing everything in your power to pursue what you think is right.//

**[https://redd.it/6pbjff SCP-2935 - O, Death]**
&gt; //It&#39;s a cave - a Keter cave. The most dangerous and hard-to-contain, unpredictable cave ever, apparently.//

**[https://redd.it/6onfkk SCP-2943 - In Case Of Emergency, Break Glass]**
&gt; //SCP-2943 is like the time version of SCP-2000. It&#39;s a way to save and load; a real-life quicksave. It&#39;s the best power, the one thing that was beyond the Foundation, delivered perfectly into their hands.//

**[https://redd.it/6qib0e SCP-2996 - ERROR / ERROR]**
&gt; //She thought she was a spirit of hatred and revenge, but it turns out that she was the one being haunted the entire time.//

**[https://redd.it/6chvde SCP-3005 - A Light That Died]**

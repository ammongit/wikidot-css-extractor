**Item #:** SCP-6614

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6614 is to be stored in the Site-64 storage wing. It is not to be handled by those in a romantic relationship. Information regarding Wyatt Sampson&#39;s and Eileen Salsburrow&#39;s disappearances not following the cover story given is to be withdrawn from its source, those viewing it not involved with the foundation receiving amnestics. 

**Description:** SCP-6614 is a 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm cube composed almost entirely of dried dates, dried figs, and prunes. Each individual fruit has approximately 50% of its mass replaced by cardiac muscle. The cardiac muscle has veins running into the center of SCP-6614, which has, with testing, been confirmed to contain a beating, human heart. They never expire, and any removal of SCP-6614&#39;s components have thus far failed, as they immediately sublimate upon doing so, with new fruits replacing them shortly after. 

When someone in a romantic relationship makes physical contact with SCP-6614, a date, a fig, and a prune will split open vertically in that order, each releasing a small paper containing information about the past, present, and future of the relationship. Experimentation has proven that information is consistently accurate. This will only take effect if the person who made contact has been in the relationship for longer than 7 days, and will still take effect if the relationship has ended at most a month prior to contact.

The date releases information about the past, the fig the present, and finally the prune the future. The figs have been the only fruit to consistently release information. Dates will fail to upon if the relationship began a month prior to contact[[footnote]]This was accidently discovered when handled by a researcher who only recently started a romantic relationship.[[/footnote]], and prunes will fail to open if the significant other has passed. 

SCP-6614 is indestructible by normal means, and will only show signs of damage if physically inflicted by someone in a romantic relationship. When this occurs, a red fluid will leak from SCP-6614, which was discovered to be a mixture composed of a varied percentage of human and deer blood, human tears, and salt water.

SCP-6614 was discovered on January 3rd, 2015, after a raid took place on the home of Markus Blaine,  one of the many leaders of the Controller of the Youth cult. This cult lures in those seeking a romantic relationship, specifically those looking to start a family, and indoctrinates them into the cult to prevent reproduction. Some of these victims will repeat this process to gain even more members. They will also execute those attempting to have families outside of the cult with numerous children and those already parenting multiple children. 

The cult believes in a god that will wreak havoc on the world if it becomes overpopulated, and wants to keep this god at peace by making these sacrifices to prevent this from occurring. The group was put under surveillance following the disappearance of Dr. ██████ and Researcher ████████ trying to uncover missing cases caused by the cult. SCP-6614 was found over some cloth in the home, and was then confiscated with testing occurring shortly after.

A prune released a paper with the following information: &#34;Jane and Daniel look so cute. You two are really happy, and live with no romance based regrets.&#34;

**Aftermath:** Dr. Lane proposed to his now fiancé a month later, with her saying yes. When questioned about who Jane and Daniel were, he appeared to lack knowledge on the matter. 

[[/div]]

No prune released a message. 

**Aftermath:** Coordinates lead to the body of Michelle █████████, who was D-1127’s ex-girlfriend. She was found with her neck snapped. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Test 6614-3**__

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Test 6614-4**__

**Subject:** Researcher Archie

**STR:** The perfect couple.

**Messages:** 
A date released a message with the following information: &#34;Such a cute couple, it almost appeared to be love at first site! Even at a memorial service, seems like some “positive vibes” can arise!&#34;

A fig released a message with the following information: &#34;The love continues to be a strong chain connection between you two. Quite stable… though the chain is, unfortunately, not flame retardant.&#34; 

A prune released a message with the following information: &#34;Only a fire extinguisher will save this relationship, but we both know you’ll ignore this. You have 2 days.&#34;

**Aftermath:** Researcher Archie said he would purchase a fire extinguisher after work, however, forgot while traveling home. Approximately 2 days later, an electrical fire began due to faulty wiring, and with no means of properly extinguishing it, caused a large uncontrollable blaze which killed both Researcher Archie and his wife.

A prune released a message with the following information: &#34;█████ ███. I&#39;m begging you. Your relationship will get better. Go to my apartment. You will find what you need there.&#34;

**Aftermath:** Wyatt Sampson&#39;s apartment was investigated shortly after this event. Wyatt Sampson was reported missing approximately 8 months ago, though no federal action was taken ~~for unknown reasons~~ as they were bribed with substantial amounts of money. The only items retrieved were a diary belonging to Wyatt Sampson, and a book belonging to the Controller of the Youth.

Below are diary excerpts from Wyatt Sampson. Note that these were copied verbatim, and certain entries have been redacted from the document.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 10/2/2013
I had quite the day today. It’s a bit rare nowadays, since business hasn’t been treating me the best, but I decided to experiment with some recipes to keep myself at peace. Discovered an excellent way to use oyster mushrooms to create the tastiest chicken marsala in existence, will definitely knock your socks off! Also attempted a nice flam with extra caramel sauce, which I managed to make with a ratio of milk and hard caramel candies, simply divine. If my marsala knocked the socks off, you bet your ass you won&#39;t be able to walk after having the flam! Over all, today was a lot better than it has been throughout the past few days. Good night, diary.

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 12/31/2013
Almost 2014…. oh how time flies. I usually don’t follow through with the New Year&#39;s resolution shit, but I would like to actually try to succeed in one this year: I want to start a family. I’m tired of being alone, I just want someone to hold and love, someone to take care of. Bottles of wine and Netflix definitely don&#39;t make me feel less lonely... anymore. I think I’ll start using some dating apps… Tinder is relatively new, but I think I’ll give it a shot. What’s the worse that can happen? Happy New Year, diary. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 1/5/2014
Tinder is proving to be a massive success… I found a girl… she’s drop-dead gorgeous. Her name is Eileen, and she also wants to start a family. In addition? She enjoys cooking, drinking, and all the other shit I enjoy. I’m hoping that this holds up, I have faith. This is the most excited I’ve been in months! Unfortunately, this is also the most nervous I&#39;ve been in months. You&#39;d think a borderline failing business would enact this more, yet it feels like I&#39;m producing galloons of sweat awaiting the date, which is this Tuesday. Wish me luck, diary. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 1/7/2014 
The date went incredibly well! The second I met her, my worries were just flushed away. Eileen is such a sweet heart, we were laughing and exchanging recipes almost the whole time! I know this is an early call but... I think this is my soul mate! I genuinely haven’t felt such a bubbly feeling since god knows when! By the time it was over, we already planned a second one, we plan to go ice skating before hand as well. The benefits of social media, am I right? It almost feels to good to be true! Goodnight, diary.

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 2/1/2014
Eileen and I have been building our relationship, I love her so much. She&#39;s quite wealthy, and you&#39;d think someone with such wealth would be a selfish snob right? She defies this stereotype, in fact, she even donated some money to help keep my business intact. How generous! She wants me to come to a meeting for the community, which I agreed to, not even letting her finish her sentence. Don’t wanna leave the girl hanging! She said it&#39;s a group dedicated to “Helping the needy”. I&#39;ll tell you what, I was absolutely needy myself, so why not help others? Used to do community service all the time with my mother anyway. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes, good night diary. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 2/6/2014
The meeting just ended a little over an hour ago? The vibes were definitely… stranger than expected, especially for a community service event. Multiple men and women appeared to be in a trance, or genuinely incoherent. I tried interacting with one of the dudes there, apparently named “Adam”, nothing but a simple &#34;Hi there&#34;... yet Eileen grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me away... why? I’m all for helping those who need it; however, so I guess I&#39;ll stick with it. Good night, diary. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 2/7/2014
I was originally planning on helping out some of my co-workers tonight; however, instead dragged to a second meeting by Eileen. Well, not literally, but she begged and pleaded. I eventually gave in, I mean, come on! She&#39;s helped me so much! Unfortunately however, the vibes got even stranger compared to last night, if you could believe that. There was a malnourished looking man who was half naked and had a popped embryo tattooed on his chest hosting this meeting, which is definitely... not normal to say the least… when I attempted to interact with him, he just stared back with his grotesque face. Nightmare fuel to say the least... fucking creep. I might ask Eileen if I can skip the next meeting… I’m pretty uncomfortable here. Not only that, but I constantly hear murmurs from members about our growing population... the fuck is that about? 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:**  2/9/2014
Eileen threatened to kill herself if I didn’t come... is this really that big of a deal? I mean, I&#39;m not willing to risk losing her over me not attending some damn meeting, but Christ, talk about a reaction! The weirdo who hosted the meeting two nights ago handed me a forum, telling me that I&#39;ll be inducted tomorrow into the group. I don’t like this at all… why would I need induction into a group like this, especially out of the blue? I’m going to tell Eileen I want to decline this offer at tomorrow&#39;s meeting. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:**  2/10/2014
SHE STRAIGHT UP FUCKING ASSULTED ME. OVER SOME GOD DAMN COMITEE MEETING??? MY NOSE IS LITERALLY POURING OUT BLOOD! I had to get out, a borderline futile action. Two strangers grabbed me and held me down, while Eileen carved some weird other-worldly symbol into my chest? I was begging them to let me go, but this fucking lunatic just wouldn&#39;t stop. I was violently kicking them, even kicking one of the dudes in the baby makers... HE DIDN&#39;T BUDGE. After this, she whispered this into my ear: &#34;You&#39;re parents won&#39;t live to see another day if you tell anyone about this.&#34; I&#39;m fucking terrified. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:**  2/11/2014
Holy shit... HOLY SHIT. THIS IS A FUCKING CULT. An older member named David told me, went into minimal detail. They want to prevent over population?! I mean yeah its a huge problem, but why the fuck was I forced to go through all of this shit? Is this that big of a deal??? God it all makes sense now... I feel betrayed. 

[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:**  2/14/2014
God help me... I&#39;m deplorable. I was forced to execute David. Eileen discovered David leaked the secret of what this is to me. She made me punish him for his sins, THIS CRAZY BITCH TOLD ME TO ████████. I begged her to not, but she threatened to give the fate to me instead so... I just had to. I&#39;ll never forget the look of terror on his face as I did it... it&#39;ll haunt me till&#39; I die. God, what the fuck should I do?!

Within the book confiscated in Wyatt Sampson&#39;s apartment, is multiple pages containing information regarding the creation of certain anomalous objects to make the cults goals more achievable. Below is a page, verbatim, regarding the anomalous object of SCP-6614.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= [[size 200%]]The Lie Cube[[/size]]
= [[size 125%]]Contributed by ███████ ████.[[/size]]


This object is the lie cube. It&#39;s purpose is to provide truthful information about the past and present of the romantic relationship, but falsified information regarding the future of it. This is incredibly useful for correcting your victims into making them see that they are in good hands. It is most certainly one of our more complicated items to make, given the time and materials required; however, I promise it&#39;s well worth your time. These nifty devices last decades, I still have mine from over ██ years ago. 

**Materials:**
*A deer or elk heart (Preferably one weighing at least 10 lbs., but no more than 16 lbs.)
*3 of the following items: 1lbs. of dried dates, 8oz. of dried pears, 4 oz. of ██████ (Preferably from a human), 1lbs. of prunes, 2.5 lbs. of raisins, 12 oz. of bacon fat, 1 lbs. of candy hearts, 2 █████ (Again, preferably from a human, specifically a young female), 1 lbs. of dried figs, or 2.5 lbs of rose petals.
*250 mL of salt water.
*Your victim. **WARNING: BE SURE THAT THE &#34;BRAINWASH PHASE&#34; IS FULLY COMPLETE (About 6 months). FAILURE TO COMPLETE THIS WILL RESULT IN A DEFECTIVE LOVE CUBE.**

**Procedure:**
[REDACTED]

After all of this, you should have a fully functioning love cube. Signs of defectiveness include: Abnormal amounts of conscious, noticeable personality, giving truthful futures, and resistance. **IF YOUR LIE CUBE DISPLAYS ANY OF THESE, DISCARD IT IMMEDIATELY, OR TURN IT INTO HEAD CULTIST ███████.** Thank you, and enjoy your new toy!

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Addendum 6614-D: Security Camera Footage&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Addendum 6614-D&#34;]] 

After multiple attempts to find Eileen Salsburrow, she was eventually located and captured through the use of a bait Tinder account. An interview was requested; however, she refused to cooperate. Due to this, it was decided that Eileen would be brought to SCP-6614, as per Wyatt&#39;s wishes. Below is a transcript of security footage taken in the room where said event took place. Researcher Mark followed Eileen, providing her with instruction.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Start:
**00:00:** Eileen: What are ya&#39;ll taking me to- //She sees SCP-6614// Oh. I see. Do ya&#39;ll want some fucking explanation or something? 

**00:03:** Mark: No ma&#39;am. I only request that you make physical interaction with the object in front of you.

**00:06:** Eileen: Why? I&#39;m sure you already know what this does, spits some shit out about relationships... it&#39;s not fucking rocket science &#34;Researcher&#34;. 

**00:09:** Mark: Please cooperate here. Action will be taken if you continue to ignore my request. 

**00:13:** Eileen: Jesus Christ, FINE. I&#39;ll touch the stupid fucking cube. 

**00:14:** //Eileen touches SCP-6614//

**00:23:** Eileen: Um... is this shit broken? It never takes this long. That&#39;s hilarious, hone-

**00:24:** //SCP-6614 proceeded to open up a date and release a message// 

**00:26:** Eileen: Finally... took this defect long enough. Look. //She shows the message to Researcher Mark// 

//The message is as followed: &#34;You two love each other so much. I can see you two being together until the end of time.&#34;//

**00:28:** Eileen: This is about my current boyfriend Brad... do ya&#39;ll ever get bored of doing this shit? All the fucking thing does is give information about relationships... please develop an actual hobby.

**00:30:** Mark: This is my job, do you not realize how something like this could terrify the public? 

**00:33:** //Eileen giggles//

**00:34:** Eileen: Yeah, I bet people are really shitting themselves over a fucking relationship device. This organization is such a-

**00:36:** //SCP-6614 proceeded to open up a fig and release a message// 

**00:38:** Eileen: Honestly... is this thing ██████? No offense but... god damn. Let me read this.

//The message is as followed: Eileen... I know who you are. I am Wyatt. I just went &#34;missing&#34; apparently? I found a method of escape.//

**00:40:** //Eileen grows pale//

**00:41:** Eileen: Um... how does it know my name? Something about this isn&#39;t right. I think you guys have a defect... //She continues reading//

**00:45:** //Eileen drops the paper//

**00:49:** Eileen: How... how is this possible. W-Wyatt... I thought he... it couldn&#39;t be him. Mark... what the fuck is this?

**00:52:** //SCP-6614 proceeded to open up a prune and released a message// 

//The message is as followed: This is where your story ends. Rest assured, you will be sharing the same fate as me. Permanently. Except your choice in the matter? Will be non existent. Just like how mine was over the 3 months of torture I endured.//

**00:53:** //Eileen starts reading, and looks up//

**00:55:** Eileen: Mark. Let me out. NOW. PLEASE. 

**00:57:** Mark: I&#39;m sorry Eileen. It would be going against procedures for this test.

**01:00:** Eileen: Test? TEST?!? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? Know what? Go fuck yourself

**01:02:** //Eileen kicks Mark&#39;s testicles, knocking him over//

**01:04:** //Eileen grabs SCP-6614 and starts to bang it violently against the door//

**01:08:** Eileen: Wyatt. I know you can hear me. I fucking hate you. I should have NEVER dated some fucking loser... w-who&#39;s such a fucking bitch, that they can&#39;t fight me like a real man! 

**01:11:** //A prune then opened up, and released a message.//

//The message is as followed: Oh Eileen. I may be a coward, but my dignity is the least of my concerns. Look what you&#39;ve done. Does anyone even love you? At least I will be going out a hero. Goodbye, Eileen. In fact...you should join me.//

**01:12:** //Eileen reads the message//

**01:15:** Eileen: What... what does that mean. 

**01:16:** //SCP-6614 starts pulsating, Eileen drops it and sprints away from it//

**01:19:** Eileen: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT???

**01:20:** Mark: What the...

**01:21:** //SCP-6614 begins to split open 3 dates, 3 figs, and 3 prunes.// 

**01:23:** Eileen: Oh my god... PLEASE HELP ME! WHAT IS IT DOING JESUS CHRIST PLEASE!

**01:25:** //The flesh and muscle from aforementioned fruits proceeded to amalgamate, producing a prodigious, human hand.//

**01:28:** Eileen: OH MY GO-

**01:29:** //The hand made a fist, and punched its way through Eileen&#39;s abdomen, ripped out her heart, and presented it 1.2 meters above her body for 5 seconds, before retreating into the center of SCP-6614, dragging the heart with it. Eileen drops to the floor shortly after the hand retreats.//


**01:37:** Mark: I...

**01:38:** //SCP-6614 released one more message from a fig//

//The message is as followed: I feel contempt. Thank you.//

**01:40:** //Mark reads it//

**01:44:** Mark: You&#39;re welcome, Wyatt. 

Following this event, SCP-6614 has released messages at random, mostly either cursing Wyatt out or begging for help. Despite still retaining its previous anomalous affects and maintaining truthful statements about relationships, some of the fruits have been seen twitching or bulging. Reclassification to Euclid is being considered.

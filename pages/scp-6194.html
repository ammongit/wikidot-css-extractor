**Item #:** SCP-6194 

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6194 is to be kept in a lounge-style chamber of any size desired at Site-██. Due to the minimal anomalous qualities of SCP-6194, the containment chamber must have only one entryway to easily monitor visitation hours, but other properties and qualifications of its chamber may be changed at will by members of the O5 council, or at the discretion of Dr.█████. Although unnecessary, other recommended accommodations include sofas, vending machines, a pool table, a small library, and several lounge chairs. Stanchions lining a small perimeter around SCP-6194 have been requested, but its therapeutic properties and lack of overcrowding problems deem this precaution unnecessary.

The containment chamber&#39;s entrance must be guarded by two (2) armed Class-C personnel and the interior evacuated by all other personnel between 2300 hours and 0100 hours each day. Attempts to resist evacuation orders during these hours are to be met with forced removal. All personnel resistant to leaving SCP-6194&#39;s containment chamber will be assigned at least two weeks of compulsory psychological evaluation and counseling.

Between 0101 hours and 2259 hours, authorized Site-██ personnel are allowed in and out of SCP-6194&#39;s containment chamber if on break, or otherwise free from assigned duties. 

**Description:** SCP-6194 is composed of two parts: SCP-6194-1 and SCP-6194-2. SCP-6194-1 is a titanium plate measured 100 cm wide x 100 cm long x 5 cm tall. It bears no artist&#39;s inscription or title. While SCP-6194-1 itself seems to hold no anomalous properties whatsoever, it does appear to be the &#34;anchor&#34; for SCP-6194-2&#39;s anomalous properties.

SCP-6194-2 is most accurately described as a mass of 225 kilograms (496.04 pounds) of ice propped on top of SCP-6194-1. SCP-6194-2 changes form daily, with the transformation happening sometime between 2330 hours and 0030 hours. SCP-6194-2 most often depicts a female human 1.68 meters (5.5 feet) in height. The size of the sculpture seems to vary, with its largest form taken to date being the Greek figure Altas, which was measured to be 5.23 meters (17.16 feet) tall. The ice appears more opaque the larger the form it takes, leading researchers to believe the change in size is possible through the incorporation of more O,,2,, gas the larger the form. This doesn&#39;t explain the instances in which SCP-6194-2 has appeared smaller in size than its mass in H,,2,,O would allow, but on-site researchers have half-jokingly related the process to a sort of &#34;Ant-Man&#34; effect, where the space between atoms is reduced.

Samples collected from SCP-6194-2 reveal its chemical composition to be regular H,,2,,O in crystallized form, although O,,2,, gas appears in microscopic bubbles on larger forms of SCP-6194-2. The weight of each form remains constant regardless of its size, further evidencing the &#34;Ant-Man&#34; theory. 

SCP-6194-2 is somewhat fragile, having the same property of &#39;shattering&#39; as normal ice. However, the temperature of SCP-6194-2&#39;s surface and interior is always measured to be the same as the surrounding air, despite liquid forms of SCP-6194-2 having never been observed or proven to exist. Furthermore, attempts to incinerate SCP-6194-2 have also ended in failure, even after shattering it to small shards and chunks. 

SCP-6194-2 also exhibits a form of &#34;good-vibes&#34; trait similar to that of SCP-999, albeit on a much smaller scale. Subjects in the presence of SCP-6194-2 have reported feeling more relaxed, and their heartbeat seems to stabilize to a level consistent with that of a relaxed state of mind. Direct contact with SCP-6194-2 or even broken-off pieces of SCP-6194-2 produces the same effect. Since the discovery of this property, Site-██ authorized its use as a therapeutic object for Site-██ personnel, and revised its special containment procedures to its modern version.

During its transformation period every night, the room SCP-6194-1 resides in locks itself through unknown means, and any surveillance cameras, equipment, or devices used to observe the chamber seem to malfunction and turn off during this period. In addition, any personnel trapped within said room during the self-imposed lockdown are found dead after the entrances are unlocked. For this reason, nobody has witnessed SCP-6194-2&#39;s making or transformation, but pieces of SCP-6194-2 outside of the room SCP-6194-1 resides in have been observed [REDACTED]. Autopsies of subjects found dead from SCP-6194&#39;s lockdown events have all found the cause of death to be cardiac arrest. The mechanism that causes this is currently unknown.</textarea></pre>

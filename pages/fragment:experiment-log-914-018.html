**Test 914-1800**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three dish brushes

**Input:** One dish brush
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An oversized toothbrush

//Note: Finally a toothbrush large enough for my mouth if you&#39;d ask my mom. - J.R. Perry//

**Input:** One dish brush
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One plastic sculpture of a hedgehog with the brush hairs functioning as the spines.

**Input:** One dish brush
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An animate plastic orb with the bristles evenly distributed across its surface. It attempted to roll towards the closest dish it considered &#39;&#39;dirty&#39;&#39;. It tried to clean said dishes, but did not have adequate force to clear off food debris effectively. After 2 minutes of &#39;&#39;trying&#39;&#39;, it became inert and did not respond any longer. Result incinerated.

**Test 914-1801**
**Name:** Dr. N Rose
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** Twelve Infrared Laser Thermometer Guns

//Note: During this test, the thermometers will be shortened to ILTG for brevity. - Dr. Rose//

//Rough and Coarse Tests omitted for brevity//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One pulse oximeter

**Input:** One of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An identical ILTG. When used by any individual, the output works in conjunction to a heat ray often used by riot control, albeit with a limited amount of use. While not lethal, the output’s “rays” do cause mild burns to any location it is aimed at. The monitor reads the area of effectiveness the output has, instead of showing the temperature.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A //NERF// brand plastic blaster resembling the Firestrike variant. Notably, the pull handle used to “cock” the blaster is replaced with a small screen. Activating the blaster via loading a standard //NERF// dart causes the screen to turn on, showing the number 350. Beside the screen are dials, of which the right dial causes the number to be either raised or lowered. Through testing, it is revealed the number refers to the distance the dart will travel, with the value being centimeters. The dial to the left instead cycles what the dart will perform upon hitting a surface or being. Listed below are a few examples.

|| **Dart Action** || **Result** ||
|| Break || The dart shatters on impact similar to sugar glass. A small dent is formed in the surface, or it breaks the bone related to the location where an individual is shot ||
|| Heal || Only works on biological matter. Any injuries shot will heal at an accelerated pace. However, if the injury requires surgery, it will not heal and instead do nothing ||
|| Penetrate || The dart works like a standard bullet, penetrating the matter. Depth of penetration, or if it goes through all vary on the matter type. The dart remains intact throughout the procedure ||
|| TQ || Only works on biological matter. Works as a tranquilizer dart. However, the effectiveness of the dart is equal, and possibly more powerful, to Ketamine. Any individual shot by the dart will enter a comatose state for a minimum time period of 8 hours. The maximum period is unclear. ||
|| Drain || Causes all forms of liquid matter to drain from the target until the subject is completely barren of any liquid. Will induce damage to certain materials, and death by exsanguination and dehydration for biological matter ||
|| Bolster || Increases the durability and strength of all matter the dart hits. However, this effect continues until eventual destruction of said matter. Individuals hit by the dart will act as if affected by steroids with a magnified effect, before having their skeleton crumble under the weight of the increased muscle mass after a period of two hours ||
|| Melt || Causes all matter struck by the dart to melt in a similar style when exposed to molten rock. Should the material be composed of matter that would make molten rock, the material will remain the same. On biological matter, all matter melts in the same way. There is no survivability. ||

//Note: Whoever thought it was a good idea to suggest this could be a great way to lure 106 during its escapes, you can personally be the guinea pig if you continue to suggest this level of idiocy. We don’t know the full extent of its abilities, and frankly, I don’t want to find out someone died because they found an explosive setting. It’s going into storage. - Dr. Rose//

**Input:** Three of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small screen with a finger scanner. When an individual places their finger on said scanner, blood is anomalously drained from the finger despite no sign of entry to the finger itself. On the screen, all medical information related to the cardiovascular system and their internal temperature. After a period of three minutes, the subject’s blood will continually drain from the scanned finger. All attempts to cease the flow without removal of the finger have failed. Amputation is the only method to stop the effect, and reattaching the finger brings the effect back. After a period of 120 hours, the subject dies due to exsanguination.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An identical ILTG. The device is constantly in an activated state, with no discernable way to deactivate it. When directed at an individual, the screen begins to detail all the medical information of the subject. While this occurs, the subject will collapse and enter a seizure. Continued analysis prolongs the seizure, but not the severity and reports the subject to be healing. As the device continues being held, the temperature of the device also raises, reaching painful levels when in contact with human skin. Releasing it reduces the effect until the device is at a room temperature heat. The resulting seizures have been confirmed non-lethal, however they are quite severe, with a 37% of epilepsy being diagnosed after recovery

**Input:** Three of the aforementioned ILTGs
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** --An orb of light--

**Addendum:**  Following the output being taken from the booth, the device activated and proceeded to anomalously float in the testing chamber. Extreme heat reaching 1407°C and light barred safe entry and visual identification, and any individuals within the chamber were incinerated. Device was disarmed following the use of the H20 9000, revealing an identical ILTG, severely charred and irreparable with an etching of an unreadable sentence and a Leviathan Cross symbol beneath. A researcher assisting with the tests noticed the cross and immediately left the area to procure a bible; said researcher was stated to be of the Catholic faith post-test. As the researcher returned, the output ignited with a red and orange hue, until doused in more water and biblical verses were recited. Output disintegrated following application of water and verses. Documentation photos taken during the inanimate stage of the etching were transferred to a language department to determine the sentence; of which was found to read //Exodus and Ruler// in Latin. Documenting photos have since been placed in a folder and held in Anomalous Storage.

**Test 914-1802**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zen
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three CO2 fire extinguishers

//Note: Due to the explosion risk, the Rough and Coarse test won&#39;t be executed. - Junior Researcher Zen//

**Input:** One CO2 fire extinguisher
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A fire extinguisher, different brand and model

**Input:** One CO2 fire extinguisher
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A similar fire extinguisher with a hand-pump on the top of it that was discovered to refill the extinguisher with new CO2 filtered from the air. Unfortunately, due to the small amounts of CO2 in the air and the limited effectiveness of a hand pump, the process of refilling is very slow. No anomalous properties were found.

**Input:** One CO2 fire extinguisher
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A similar extinguisher with a greater weight. When the Output chamber was opened, the present D-Class felt the air being sucked inside, presumably due to an underpressure. Tests revealed that the extinguisher now shoots a mix of CO2 and N2 in liquid form (the most of although vaporizes just coming out) at a pressure of 300 bars and a temperature of -170 C°. It is believed that the azote was taken from the chamber, explaining the underpressure. The capacity to resist pressure of the object is beyond the actual possibilities but it&#39;s believed to be non-anomalous and simply a modification of the metal structure to make it capable of resisting that pressure. The D-Class that tested it is now being treated for the gangrene on his hand caused by the sudden drop in temperature. Due to the high pressure, destroying the object is considered too dangerous and it is stored in the Anomalous Storage.

----
**Test 914-1803**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zen
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** Five wooden bows, thirty wooden arrows

**Input:** One wooden bow, six arrows
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of wood splinters, metal splinters, and pieces of synthetic feathers.

**Input:** One wooden bow, six arrows
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Each component, nearly separated.

**Input:** One wooden bow, six arrows
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A pair of tomahawks, which are throwing weapons of Native American origins. Some feathers and wood splinters, presumably the ones in excess, were in a separate pile.

**Input:** One wooden bow, six arrows
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A crossbow and eight darts. The bowstring has a complicated multiple-passage system to give it elasticity in a shorter space. Some metal pieces are included in the crossbow, like a metal trigger and a tiny metal sight. The crossbow has high precision but no anomalous properties were found.

**Input:** One wooden bow and six arrow
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One wooden bow and six arrows, physically identical to the input. During the test, it was discovered that when used, the arrow binds itself to the user&#39;s hand, causing the user to accelerate forward with the arrow when it is released. The effect ceases when the user or the arrow hits something.

**Addendum:** During a test a D-Class, a skilled archer, was able to use his other hand to grab the bow during the shot, allowing him to become airborne multiple times in a row until he tried to jump on a suspended light on the ceiling that immediately broke and made him fall, resulting in moderate injuries.

----
**Test 914-1804**
**Name:** Researcher Andrew Moore
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** One personnel dossier for Andrew Moore; one bottle of cat spray, used for disciplining domesticated cats

**Input:** Personnel Dossier
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One personnel dossier for &#34;Researcher Emily Moore&#34;, closely matching Researcher Moore&#39;s background and achievements. There is no record of an Emily Moore having worked at the Foundation, and Researcher Moore has no relatives with the name.

//Note: I have no idea what this means, but I have a weird feeling it will be very important down the line. I&#39;m keeping this in my desk. - Researcher Moore//

**Input:** One bottle of cat spray
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One bottle of &#34;spray cat&#34;. When used, it produces a cat with an average age of 2 years. A wide range of breeds have been observed. Cats evaporate after around 30 minutes if left alone, and near-instantly if terminated, making autopsies impossible. Item incinerated.

----
**Test 914-1805**
**Name:** Researcher A. Lopez, Researcher R. Skye
**Date:** 18/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three origami papers, a copy of Researcher R. Skye&#39;s ID

**Input:** Origami papers folded to the style of a cuboctahedron with a drawing of a rectangle in one of the squares in marker
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A flat sheet of thick paper in a rectangular shape with faded ink. When D-13423 picked up the sheet of paper, began cheering, and when questioned, said that he explained how &#34;he now has a billion credits to buy an Asp&#34;. After removing the output, D-13423 returned to normal.

//Note: Not sure if he means a snake or anything, but credits aren&#39;t a currency. - A. Lopez//

**Input:** The aforementioned ID card
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An ID card. Screening showed that the output is a genuine Foundation ID card with no changes.

//Note: I&#39;ve been expecting anything but normal, and it gives me normal. - R. Skye//

----
**Test 914-1806**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Davidson
**Date:** 19/05/2021
**Total Items:** Four passenger car tires

**Input:** One tire
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Two halves of a tire

**Input:** One tire
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A tire with a different tread 

**Input:** One tire
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A tire that can adapt its size to fit any wheel. During testing, it was discovered that it only adapts to the wheels of Honda cars. When the wheel was removed from the Honda car, the tire removed itself and returned to its original form. The tire also changes its tread to fit the current season of the year.

**Input:** One tire 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:**  An animate tire that is impervious to most damage. When attacked, the output will bounce at the attacker until they go out of range, at which point it will begin to self-repair. When within range of a vehicle, the output attempts to attach itself to its wheel, and the only way to remove it is to remove the entire wheel from the vehicle, at which point the output will detach itself from the wheel and return to its original form. 

----
**Test 914-1807**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Assorted //LEGO DUPLO// bricks in varying colors and shapes, one //LEGO// Assembly Square set #10255 (unassembled in box)

//Note: After some discussion with the other personnel a little while ago, we decided to do a series of tests using// LEGO //bricks. Everyone got to choose which sets or bricks they wanted to input, as well as whether or not they wanted to assemble them prior to putting them through 914. I strongly urge everybody in the facility to ensure that they are wearing adequate footwear (which you should be already) so as to not get injured by stepping on any stray pieces. For my first two tests, I&#39;ll be using// DUPLO //bricks, which are larger and simpler versions of the original// LEGO //bricks that are meant to be handled by toddlers. - JR Boneka//

**Input:** Assorted //LEGO DUPLO// bricks
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Physically unaltered //LEGO DUPLO// bricks. Testing with a D-Class reveals that the bricks expose a cognitohazard to anybody using them that makes them mentally incapable of being able to put together or separate the bricks.

**Addendum:** After further testing, it was discovered that Junior Researchers and interns are not affected by the cognitohazard and are thus capable of manipulating the output without any complications.

//Note: It&#39;s calling us toddlers. I feel mildly insulted, but I did choose to do my test using toys meant for children, so I suppose I just won stupid prizes. The next test will be conducted using a much more complex set. - JR Boneka//

**Input:** One //LEGO// Assembly Square set #10255 (unassembled in box)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One //LEGO// set (unassembled in box) resembling a standard SCP Foundation site. The fully-constructed model includes containment chambers, personnel offices, and research labs, as well as several //LEGO// minifigures resembling researchers, MTF agents, D-Class personnel, and SCPs, specifically SCP-173, SCP-049, and SCP-682. A model of SCP-914 is also included in the set. The output has no anomalous properties, although it is noted that one of the doors to a containment chamber does not shut properly due to a construction error present in the instruction manual that prevents it from swinging all the way.

----
**Test 914-1808**
**Name:** Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** One limited edition //LEGO// Millennium Falcon set #7190 (disassembled in box) 

**Input:** Aforementioned //LEGO// box
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A visually unchanged set. Anomalous effects manifest when the set has been fully assembled. Individual pieces will periodically detach themselves from the complete model, meaning that constant maintenance is required in order to put the loose pieces back in place before the model completely disassembles itself. Whenever the output has fully disassembled itself, every loose piece will be launched at varying speeds in all directions. Output incinerated after the set “exploded” a second time. 

----
**Test 914-1809**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Davidson
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three //LEGO// Mindstorms &#34;Robot Inventor&#34; sets #51515

**Input:** One robotic vehicle built using the &#34;Robot Inventor“ set 
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Unassembled //LEGO// bricks and wiring

**Input:** One &#34;Robot Inventor“ set
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A fully assembled four-legged //LEGO// robot which is able to move by itself

**Input:** One &#34;Robot Inventor“ set
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A humanoid //LEGO// robot with different kinds of //LEGO// gear. The gear is composed of a sword, a hammer, a shield and a brick launcher. When the gear was tested, the sword was discovered to be sharpened. The hammer had the properties of a full size hammer except for the fact that anytime it hit something, it damaged itself due to the fact that it is made out of plastic. The shield was able to deflect all attacks with minimal damage to itself and the brick launcher was discovered to be loaded with sharpened //LEGO// sticks which were discovered to not be dangerous except for the fact that they can pierce a person. The robot is able to replenish these sticks only when given more more unsharpened //LEGO// sticks. Stored in Anomalous Storage.

----
**Test 914-1810**
**Name:** Researcher MacLean 
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Various //LEGO// motors and gears


**Input:** One //LEGO// motor, various //LEGO// gears
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small plastic car. The casing is composed of the same material as the motor’s original casing. Disassembly shows that there is no way to connect a battery to the motor, making it unusable.

**Input:** Various //LEGO// gears
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A wind-up mainspring, made of plastic. The mainspring is extremely efficient, but has no attachment points, making it unable to be integrated into a clockwork system.

//Note: We have a motor set that doesn’t accept a power source, and a power source that can’t be attached to anything. Let&#39;s see if we can’t get anything interesting out of them. - Researcher MacLean//

**Input:** One //LEGO// motor, various //LEGO// gears, the previous two outputs
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A cube of composed of plastic gears and wheels, appearing to move and rotate at random. The cube is powered by a device that generates power when moved, resulting in the cube being powered by both its own movements and the vibrations of the surface it is placed on. The device was broken during attempted disassembly and rendered nonfunctional. 

----
**Test 914-1811**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Syc Abrams
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** A set of assorted //LEGO// bricks in varying shapes, colours and sizes

**Input:** The aforementioned set of bricks
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A plastic gramophone assembled using the //LEGO// bricks. However, the output lacks an arm typically found on a gramophone. Testing also revealed that the output contains a cognitohazardous effect that causes anyone within 5m to perceive the gramophone as playing their favorite song. Removing even a single brick from the output ends the effect, but replacing said brick causes the effect to resume. Using a brick of a different colour to replace the missing brick also causes the effect to resume.

**Addendum:** Further testing revealed that the cognitohazardous effect is entirely lost if the output is completely disassembled and subsequently reassembled, thus accidentally neutralising the output.

----
**Test 914-1812**
**Name:** Intern Beauvillier
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Two sets of assorted //LEGO// bricks, containing diverse bricks of various shapes, colours, and sizes. The set also contains a small plastic tool designed to assist in disassembling lego pieces.

//Note: This is a standard building set, containing regular pieces. Enough to build almost anything. - Intern Beauvillier//

**Input:** A set of assorted //LEGO// bricks
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A visibly unchanged set. However, disassembling two bricks that were connected together is physically impossible, without using the specific tool that was provided with the set itself.
Disassembling bricks with the brick disassembler gets the brick stuck to the disassembler, and it is impossible to disassemble them without a second disassembler, to which the bricks disassembled from the first will attach themselves to and get stuck to. Even though the entire assemblage still works as a disassembler and can separate two assembled bricks, it is highly unpractical as bricks will still be unusable.

**Input:** Same as before
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A plastic box containing an extremely thick liquid made out of plastic, and a plastic hammer, supposedly made with the unassembling tool. Molding the liquid into specific forms is possible due to its high viscosity. Hitting the liquid with the hammer will anomalously solidify the liquid in a 5 centimeters radius of the impact zone, allowing other //LEGO// bricks to connect to the solidified area. Hitting a solidified area with the hammer will turn it back to liquid.

----
**Test 914-1813**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Reimer
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Two //LEGO// Architecture Willis Tower sets #21000 (not assembled)

**Input:** One of the aforementioned sets
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A //LEGO// Architecture set of the One World Trade Center, numbered #21800. //LEGO// is not known to have produced such a set. 

**Input:** One of the aforementioned sets
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A //LEGO// Architecture set of the Palace of Culture and Science (PKiN), Warsaw. When assembled, an anomalous property manifests, wherein all biological matter in direct contact with the object disappeared.

**Addendum:** All personnel who disappeared later reappeared in their original locations. According to their accounts, they were transported into the Congress Hall of the PKiN, after which they were able to explore the interior of the building. No deviations from the actual building was noted, and all personnel and items return to their original location after exactly 1176 minutes. Object has been incinerated afterwards.

----
**Test 914-1814**
**Name:** Dr. N Rose
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three //LEGO// Star Wars Super Star Destroyer sets #10221

//Note: Two of the sets remain disassembled in their boxes. The third is constructed, and the box and schematics will be included in the test. - Dr. Rose//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned sets (disassembled in box)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One //LEGO// Star Wars Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser set #8039

//Note: I won’t lie, I did wish that 914 would bring out a Spaceball One model. Disappointing, however results are results. The model is cleared and placed into storage. - Dr. Rose//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned sets (disassembled in box)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An unchanged box, When the box is opened, the //LEGO// pieces vibrate rapidly within their plastic set bags, before tearing them all at once and becoming a large mass of loose pieces. The pieces, when at rest, act in a manner similar to a Non-Newtonian fluid. When the pieces are used in the appropriate fashion, they will construct into any structure the amount of pieces will allow. Adding pieces do not add to the effect, and will simply fall away or be moved by the active pieces. Testing is ongoing.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned sets (assembled)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An anomalously flying model of an Imperial Star Destroyer. As the model flies, it will do so in a circular fashion, not deviating from the pattern until the box it was previously contained in is moved; the box itself is the focal point, with the model circling it constantly. Despite its movement, the model is destructible, and will crash into any surface obstructing its path. When reconstructed, the model will resume flying. Any attempt to construct the model with different pieces or with a modified design will not result in flight. The model also anomalously capable of minor communication with radios, however the model only transmits quotes from the series.

**Test 914-1815**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Faris
**Date:** 20/05/2021
**Total Items:** Three green 2x4 //LEGO// bricks

**Input:** The aforementioned bricks
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Three green 2x4 //LEGO// bricks. Upon being touched during retrieval by JR Faris, the bricks proceeded to explode into a fine dust, covering the output booth and nearby area with a layer of plastic. Later analysis showed the dust to be microscopic //LEGO// bricks, which are near-impossible to connect due to their size. The output booth was thoroughly cleaned and a bag of collected particulate has been placed in storage pending further analysis of its microscopic construction. JR Faris suffered no lasting ill effects due to proper use of protective equipment.

----
**Test 914-1816**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 20/05/2020
**Total items:** One 2x4 //LEGO// brick (pink)

**Input:** One 2x4 //LEGO// brick (pink)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 2x4 //LEGO// brick (black). When not looked at directly and if a step is taken within 2 square meters of it, it will anomalously manifest inside the shoe of that individual before their foot is put down. Two Jr. Researchers were brought to the hospital wing after a chain reaction affected 11 personnel until J.R. Perry stayed on the ground and removed her shoe, allowing her to keep looking at it until it could be incinerated.

//Note: So much for adequate footwear. - J.R. Boneka//

//Note: So now I know why my mom wanted me to clean my room. - J.R. Perry//

**Test 914-1816**
**Name:** Junior Researcher S. Reid
**Date:** 21/05/2021
**Total Items:** Five 9L aluminium buckets

//Note: My transfer request has finally been approved. Hi everyone, I’m Junior Researcher Sam Reid. I was working at Site-19 proper but when I came across these test logs, I had to work here. Looking forward to working with 914. - Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Input:** One 9L aluminium bucket
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A puddle of molten aluminium

**Input:** One 9L aluminium bucket
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One ball of aluminium 7 cm in diameter

**Input:** One 9L aluminium bucket
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One aluminium compressed air canister. Testing showed the canister contain exactly 9L of air.

//Note: Wow. 914 is already impressing me. Giving me ideas for testing using different substances inside containers. - Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Input:** One 9L aluminium bucket
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One aluminium hourglass. Sides are not transparent but when turned there is the sound of sand pouring, presumably made from aluminium. Timer takes exactly 9 minutes.

**Input:** One 9L aluminium bucket
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One aluminium tube. Item is anomalously resistant to heat and external force. Solid objects pass through the tube unaffected, but when liquids or granular solids, such as sand, are poured into one end of the tube they disappear exactly halfway through. Turning the end of the output over causes it to pour out the substance from the end it was poured into. Each end can have a different substance poured into it but doing so causes the downward facing end to pour out its contents unless a lid or other seal is applied. No limit has been found to the storage capacity of either end of the output. Placed in Anomalous Storage.

//Note: Some interesting items on my first test. And not dead. Yet. - Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Test 914-1817**
**Name:** Intern François Beauvillier
**Date:** 24/05/2021
**Total Items:** A Snecma-88 Jet engine, typically used in the French Rafale aircraft.

**Input:** A Snecma-88 Jet engine
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A Snecma-88 Jet engine, disassembled into parts, according to their use, such as turbines, compressors, fuel injectors, etc.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** The precedent parts, disassembled in pieces. They were neatly arranged on the floor of the output booth and sorted by size.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** All the pieces, disassembled into their core components. For example, wires were separated from their insulation, and pipes were separated into segments.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Piles of small bricks composed of diverse materials and metals such as rubber, steel, tin, lead, or copper. All bricks were of the same size of 3.538 cm by 3.538 cm by 6.96 mm.

//Note: Each of these brick is exactly a hundredth of the size of the original jet engine. - Intern François Beauvillier//

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Single blocks composed of the jet engine&#39;s materials.

//Note: The following test might be extremely dangerous. We are reaching extreme disassembly levels. It will be conducted by me and the output will be retrieved by a D-Class wearing a Hazardous Material protection suit. - Intern Beauvillier//

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Multiple large piles of powder, presumably composed each from the individual atoms composing the jet engine.

**Addenda:**

//TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS://
At T+0 seconds, D-20243, who was sent to retrieve the output opened the Output booth.
At T+0.22 seconds all visual contact was lost, both for cameras and eyewitnesses. Note that the camera were still functional at the time.
At T+4 seconds, the camera feed was cut due to technical malfunctions.
At T+8 seconds, D-20243 said he felt &#34;extremely uncomfortable, like [his] insides were being rubbed with sand paper&#34;. At the same moment, Intern Beauvillier requested immediate lockdown of the room, including hermetically sealing the door to the room and closing all aeration vents.
At T+15 seconds, the D-Class reported extreme difficulty to breathe, with what felt like &#34;a billion needles in [his] throat&#34;, and requested to be let out immediately. His request wasn&#39;t acknowledged.
At T+17 seconds, he let out a scream of help, described as &#34;guttural&#34; by the security agents.
At T+20 seconds, the D-Class expired.
At T+36 seconds, as Intern Beauvillier understood the nature of the output, he requested use of the H20-9000 and sprayed the door in its entirety. Then, he requested all nearby test personnel to leave the room and corridor, and lock themselves in a hermetical room.
At T+185, after ensuring all people were secured, Intern Beauvillier took the H2O-9000 again, activated the emergency sprinklers, and opened the door to Testing Cell 109-B. A grey cloud came out of the room, but was quickly stopped via the combined use of the H2O-9000 and the sprinklers.

//NATURE OF THE OUTPUT:// Subsequent analysis showed that the cubes were disassembled into their smallest possible state, atoms. When the Output booth was opened, the air movement caused the powder to lift extremely suddenly and rapidly, spreading throughout the entire room. Their size allowed the particles to penetrate the tiniest gaps, including in the camera, causing dysfunctions, but also in the joints between the air canisters attached to the Hazmat Suit and the pipes linking them to the suit itself. The D-Class was breathing iron atoms for 20 seconds, causing his death. Autopsy revealed extremely severe lacerations of the respiratory ducts and complete destruction of the lungs. When Intern Beauvillier opened the door, the cloud spread out of the testing cell, but most of the particles were caught in the water barrage and got stuck down on the floor. However, some passed through, and were inhaled by Intern Beauvillier, who was on scene with the H2O-9000. He is currently in the med-bay, being treated for acute lung irritation. After combined effort from the security guards in the facility, the amount of dangerous particles in the air was reduced to low levels, sufficient to render the air breathable. Further filtration efforts are still ongoing, but the conditions are harmless, except in case of permanent exposure in Cell 109-B. Unexpectedly, SCP-914 stayed completely clean.

//Note: I think I just proved the dangers of a mostly unexplored setting. This should serve as an example on the dangers of SCP-914, and how unexpected the outputs may be, even with settings we thought safe. - Intern François Beauvillier//

**Test 914-1818**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly, J.R. Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 26/05/2021
**Total Items:** One photo of Researcher Connolly, one photo of J.R. Evangeline Perry

//Note: I want to see if 914 can form patterns based on people with limited interaction. J.R. Perry has graciously accepted my request for a volunteer, given that we have not interacted much. - Researcher Connolly//

**Input:** Both of the above photos
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Two photos, one of Researcher Connolly and one of J.R. Perry. The contents of the photos have changed noticeably, with Researcher Connolly in an elaborate cosplay of Lady Dimitrescu from //Resident Evil Village//. J.R. Perry appears in cosplay as the character Heisenberg, the brother of Lady Dimitrescu, from the same game.

//Note: Not what I expected. - J.R. Perry//

//Note: And yet, not altogether unpleasant. It really got the likeness down. - Researcher Connolly//

**Test 914-1819**
**Name:** Junior Researcher S. Reid
**Date:** 28/05/2021
**Total Items:** Five &#39;&#39;useless&#39;&#39; machines

//Note: A “useless” machine is a small acrylic box containing electronic device with a single switch on the top and a metal rod hidden inside the box. When the switch changes position, the device’s arm is driven by an electric motor to emerge from the device and change the switch to its original position. This test is to see how 914’s tendency to create functionally useless outputs will interact with an input that is designed to be useless. – Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Input:** One “useless” machine
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** The original input, severely damaged. Object seems to have been subjected to extreme compressing force, not unlike what would be expected to happen if it were crushed under a hydraulic press. 

**Input:** One “useless” machine
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** The acrylic box that housed the device, unchanged. All components have been removed and are arranged compactly inside the box.

**Input:** One “useless” machine
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One small box made of metal with an acrylic switch on the top. The box contains a complex system of acrylic clockworks that result in a completely mechanical version of a “useless” machine. Changing the switch causes an acrylic rod, driven mechanically by the clockworks, to change the switch to its original position. None of the electrical components of the input are present. Further testing showed the metal box is made from an alloy of all the metals present in the switch, metal rod, and electrical components.

//Note: This alloy should be impossible to make, as should many of the smaller acrylic pieces inside the box. – Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Input:** One “useless” machine
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One miniature model of SCP-914. An exact analysis could not be conducted due to the extreme complexity of 914’s internal workings. The only apparent change is the selection panel, which only possesses the 1:1 setting. Device has no anomalous properties.

//Note: If I didn’t know better, I would say this is 914 admitting itself to be a slightly more complex useless machine. – Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Input:** One “useless” machine
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One featureless black orb made of a theoretically impossible plastic/metal alloy. Internal scans have shown the object to be solid. Has an anomalous effect that causes a human that touches it to have a vison of an event that will occur in the near future. These visions seem to be presented in such a way that the subject cannot do anything to change the events that they see. Once an individual receives a vision, they will not receive another one for 24hrs. Extensive tests were done. Most tests resulted in visions with minimal substance, such a researcher dropping a pen, or checking their watch. A list of notable tests has been compiled below.

Notable Tests:
||~ Subject ||~ Vision ||~ Results ||
|| D-49678 || D-49678 dropping the output on her foot. || D-49678 was startled by the vision and dropped the output on her foot. Output was undamaged. ||
|| D-49678 (test conducted 24hrs after initial test) || Junior Researcher S. Reid asking D-49678 to recount the details of the vision. || Junior Researcher S. Reid asked D-49678 to recount the details of her vision ||
|| D-55868 || Junior Researcher S. Reid sucking his thumb. || While transcribing the events of the vison, Junior Researcher S. Reid received a papercut on his thumb and instinctively sucked on the wound ||
|| D-65412 || D-65412 being restrained by security. || D-65412 refused to co-operate, stating “If I don’t tell ya what’s gonna happen, then it ain’t gonna happen”. D-65412 was restrained by security and escorted back to D-Class Personnel Residence. While being escorted, D-65412 alluded to security the nature of his vision. “But I didn’t tell ya. How did it still happen?” ||
|| D-12589 || D-55868 spilling water on themselves. || Surveillance recordings confirm that D-55868 spilled water on themself a few seconds after this test took place. ||
|| D-12589 (this test was conducted 24hrs after the initial test) || D-12589 sees Junior Researcher S. Reid checking their driver’s licence. || When asked what they saw in their vision, D-12589 quoted Junior Researcher S. Reid’s licence number. Junior Researcher S. Reid immediately checked his licence to confirm. After confirming, D-12589 was asked how they knew this and stated they had seen Junior Researcher S. Reid checking his licence. ||
|| D-79356 || D-79356 stubbed their toe on a desk. || D-79356 was surprised by the vision and took a step backwards. This caused them to lose their balance, taking a recovery step forwards. As they did so, they stubbed their toe on a desk. ||
|| Junior Researcher S. Reid (testing was cleared after extensive data showed the visions to be safe)  || SCP-204 breaching containment at Site-██. || by the time Junior Researcher S. Reid reported this vision, Site-██ was already in a Code: Red lockdown due to SCP-204 breaching containment. ||

//Note: Further testing to see if this can be used as an early warning system is pending. Practical use seems unlikely given the nature of 914. Output moved to Anomalous Storage. – Junior Researcher S. Reid//

**Test 914-1820**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Davidson
**Date:** 01/06/2021
**Total Items:** Two half USD coins, one 50 USD bill

**Input:** One half USD coin
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Copper and nickel dust

**Input:** One 50 USD bill
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A 100 Czech crown bill

**Input:** One half USD coin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One half USD coin exhibiting a cognitohazard that makes people without protective goggles think it is a full dollar.

**Test 914-1821**
**Name:** Dr. N Rose
**Date:** 05/06/2021
**Total Items:** Six tongue depressors

//Note: These are literally wooden popsicle sticks. I had a few of these lying around in the medbay and I hadn’t used any in a while. May as well put them to use. - Dr. Rose//

**[Rough and Coarse tests omitted for brevity]**

**Input:** One of the aforementioned depressors
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A popsicle stick similar to those used for //Magnum// brand ice-creams

**Input:** One of the aforementioned depressors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An identical popsicle stick. When the stick is placed inside an individual’s mouth, the stick will adhere itself to the tongue or roof of the mouth. Removing the stick is regarded as extremely painful and results in severe damage to the gums and teeth, should it connect with the teeth in any way. Surgical removal is possible, and is considered the only safe way to remove the stick.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned depressors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small amount of toothpicks. During testing, --the toothpicks worked as normal and showed no anomalous effects.--

**Addendum:** Further testing revealed that the toothpicks shattered very easily and get sharper with each destruction, and individuals would come under a cognitohazardous effect that compels them to continue to use the toothpicks, despite their size, dangers, and the lack of foreign matter between the subject&#39;s teeth. A D-Class used in testing suffered severe lacerations to the inside of their mouth and throat, requiring surgery to remove the toothpicks. All instances have been incinerated since testing concluded.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned depressors
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An identical depressor engraved with the phrase &#34;Ahh!&#34;. A cognitohazard affects anyone who views it, and is forced to open their mouth beyond the capability granted naturally. At its worst, the mandible is dislocated from the cranium and leads to minor damage to the cheek tissues. At this point, the effect will cease entirely, though the individual will be unable to close their jaw until medical assistance is attained. Following reattachment surgery, the individual will be left with scar tissue on the sides of their face.

**Test 914-1822**
**Name:** Technical Researcher Corsac
**Date:** 19/06/2021
**Total Items:** One USB stick containing a photograph of SCP-914. The file is digitally signed with standard Foundation cryptography software, using a key that was generated specifically for this test.

**Input:** One USB stick as above
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One USB stick containing a similar photograph of SCP-914, taken from a different angle. A valid digital signature was present, apparently created using the key that was generated for this test.

//Note: This indicates a serious flaw in the cryptographic algorithms that were used for the test. Further research is pending. – TR Corsac//

**Test 914-1823**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Singley
**Date:** 21/06/2021
**Total Items:** Three //Hot Wheels// brand miniature race cars

**Input:** One //Hot Wheels// brand miniature race car
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One //Metal Machines// brand miniature race car

**Input:** One //Hot Wheels// brand miniature race car
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** --Identical to input.-- Testing showed that the car&#39;s axle had significantly less friction with the car&#39;s body than would be expected of a normal car of the same design. Comparison testing showed an average of a 67% increase in average distance traveled across a flat terrain relative to the unaltered model when equal force was applied to both cars.

**Input:** One //Hot Wheels// brand miniature race car
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A much more detailed version of the original car. The car has been modified to function as a working car, with any and all necessary components and machinery in order to be fueled, start the engine, and drive. However, the size of the vehicle and the non-durable materials it was originally constructed from make it impractical to run, drive, or even fuel.

**Test 914-1824**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta
**Date:** 21/06/2021
**Total Items:** Three USB drives, each containing different photographs of Researcher Laskenta&#39;s office

//Note: Standard Foundation cryptography can be compromised within less than ten minutes by 914, as test 914-1822 showed. As such, attempting to compromise other algorithms could give us an insight, if 914 is exploiting security vulnerabilities or using anomalous methods and could tell us if our algorithm is flawed. - Laskenta//

**Input:** One USB drive as above, encrypted with RC4, an algorithm with severe security flaws
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The input, encrypted with a different RC4 key. In a non-anomalous context, this is only possible by compromising or knowing the key. The photograph of Researcher Laskenta&#39;s office was found unaltered after breaking the new encryption.

**Input:** One USB drive as above, encrypted with AES, the standard encryption for classified documents in the USA
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A plastic and metal plate, made out of the input. Several diagrams, taken from the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197, the document in which AES is defined, are engraved into the output. As all data has been lost, it is impossible to draw conclusions about SCP-914&#39;s cryptographic abilities.

**Input:** One USB drive as above, encrypted with one-time pad, an encryption technique that cannot be cracked with non-anomalous methods
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The inputted USB drive, containing no coherent data. It is hypothesised that the content has been encrypted with a different one-time pad key, however, this cannot be proven. As it is equally probable that SCP-914 replaced the encrypted photograph with unreadable data, no conclusions can be drawn from this output as well.

//Note: We- I didn&#39;t think this through when I scheduled only three tests. - Laskenta//

**Test 914-1825**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry and Medical Intern Rue Vos
**Date:** 23/06/2021
**Total Items:** Three physical copies of the video game //League of Legends//

//Note: Because we both play it and hate it. - J.R. Perry//

**Input:** A physical copy of the video game //League of Legends//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A physical copy of the video game //Dota 2//

**Input:** A physical copy of the video game //League of Legends//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A physically unaltered copy of the video game //League of Legends// On testing, it was found that inserting the disc into a computer would automatically display a GIF of an animated salt shaker until the disc is ejected.

**Input:** A physical copy of the video game //League of Legends//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A game disc box, blank, and a puddle of ink, used to print the previous //League of Legends// artwork. The game manual has been altered and now displays breathing exercises and tips on how to deal with anger issues. Attempting to insert the disc into a drive results in it auto-ejecting with enough speed and force to break the disc tray and embed itself into the wall.

//Note: Turns out even the game itself is telling us to stop playing it, maybe it&#39;s time. - M.I. Vos//

//Note: Never. - J.R. Perry//

**Test 914-1826**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Morganna
**Date:** 10/07/2021
**Total Items:** One standard lab coat, one kg each tungsten, tungsten carbide, and hardened steel

**Input:** Above items
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One metalized lab coat mannequin with no openings. --Impervious to damage-- Anomalously dissipates all energy applied to it evenly throughout a spherical area with a 15-meter radius, centered on the object. Kinetic forces are applied radially outward, atom by atom, regardless of mass. Due to it redistributing its gravitational potential energy in the same manner, small unsecured objects are repelled over time, and light wind is always present. To protect from the possibility of damage to the incinerator and surrounding areas, the object was placed in Anomalous Storage.

//Note: While heat is spread out, it does still affect the object as much as anything else within the affected area. It would be theoretically possible, if impractical, to melt it using extreme high heat via lasers or similar directed-energy devices. However, there’s no guarantee that would disable the anomaly, and if it applies to each particle of the thing, it could be difficult to collect. The last thing we need is vaporized anomalous material. - J.R. Morganna//

**Test 914-1827**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 19/07/2021
**Total Items:** One GPS (Global Positioning System) unit

**Input:** One GPS unit
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One physically unchanged GPS unit. The voiceover settings list the names of various personnel employed at Facility 19-23. Selecting one will not only change the GPS&#39;s voice guide to match the voice of the corresponding personnel, but also affects many of the ways in which the GPS functions, sometimes in ways that are beyond the capabilities of a normal GPS. A partial list of how each voiceover affects the GPS&#39;s functions is included below.

//Note: For the purpose of testing, the output has been installed in a standard car and relocated to another site with the appropriate size and facilities for driving in. The driving range is entirely enclosed within Site grounds, and D-Class personnel known to be cooperative have been selected to perform the following tests by driving the vehicle according to the GPS. - JR Boneka//

||~ Name ||~ Function ||
|| Intern Beauvillier || Any and all directions inputted into the GPS will be modified in a way to get the vehicle the closest to French territory as possible. In the case of the current test, it redirected the driver in the direction of the French Ambassy in the U.S. It will also, during the trip, heavily praise French culture, gastronomy, and landscapes. While using the GPS, French becomes the only language available for all on-board systems including the device itself. It also allows the radio to receive French radio broadcasting. ||
|| Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry || When this setting is selected, the GPS only allows the user to set routes for specific destinations, each one corresponding to the preferences of various personnel employed at Facility 19-23. The routes can&#39;t be edited, nor can new destinations be added. For example, J.R. Perry&#39;s destination is the nearest video game arcade, J.R. Boneka&#39;s destination is the nearest candy shop, and Dr. Veritas&#39; destination is a route directly back to his office with the warning &#34;Without the car.&#34; vocalized when beginning the route. ||
|| Researcher Laskenta || The voiceover setting disables any navigational aid of the system with the exception of the displayed map. The voice guide will instead confront occupants with peeved notes about damaged parts of the car or poor quality of used roads. Most notably, the voice guide vocalised after a series of tests: &#34;It&#39;s been three hours of proving grounds and deliberately damaged cars. There is only so much for me to say in a roundabout way.&#34; ||
|| Dr. Nick Rose Ph.D || Technical terms used by the GPS have been replaced with medical vocabulary; for example, moving the vehicle forward will prompt for an anterior motion, and a small distance is referred to as a proximal distance. Distances are replaced with the metric equivalent. However, smaller distances, at a maximum of 100m, will be regarded as centimetres. When selecting destination waypoints, the GPS displayed a preferred destination of restaurants, liquor stores or dive-bars when picking destinations. Upon choosing a custom destination, the GPS will instead direct them to the aforementioned locations closest to the requested destination. || 
|| Researcher MacLean || When this voiceover is active, the GPS will begin overheating and exhibit visual and auditory glitches. Whenever the car is stopped or its speed is changed by more than 24 kilometers per minute, the GPS will begin using an alternative route and add an additional stop. Stops are random but illicit in nature, and have included active crime scenes, condemned buildings, areas with known gang affiliations, and drug dens. || 
|| Junior Researcher Abrams || All directions given by the GPS are sung to the tune of the song &#34;Universe On Fire&#34; composed by the band //Gloryhammer//. Furthermore, the car heater&#39;s temperature is set to a constant 30 degrees Celsius and is unable to be changed. ||
|| WR Markham || The GPS&#39;s interface becomes mirrored left-to-right, and requests the driver to drive in reverse. The directions also prioritize paths that pass through city centres, and in particular city halls. This significantly lengthens the trips. ||
|| Weapons Researcher Szymons || The GPS&#39; language will be changed to a virtually incomprehensible mix of Polish and English. Sudden redirections and changes to the course occur often, and will direct the driver into the nearest barrier or wall, causing them to crash if the directions are followed. The GPS will sporadically change certain settings of the vehicle&#39;s onboard systems, like shifting cruise control speeds, or reformatting the dashboard&#39;s display if one is available. Upon mention of a destination, the GPS&#39; voice will give a long, anecdotal speech about said destination which can continue even after reaching the inputted location. || 
|| JR Boneka || The GPS adamantly refuses to calculate any routes and instead requests that the driver take public transport. ||
|| Dr. Veritas || When this setting is selected, a driving route is calculated that loops back on itself, similar to a driving exam. Mistakes cause the GPS to deliver electric shocks to the user, including when the D-Class (who originated from the UK) attempted to drive on the left side. Comments include &#34;read the signs, it says 40&#34;, &#34;are you intoxicated?&#34;, &#34;you&#39;re swerving around like a maniac&#34;, and &#34;both hands on the wheel, two and ten o&#39;clock!&#34;. When concluding the trip, the GPS told the D-Class to &#39;&#39;get back to work&#39;&#39; and short-circuited. ||

**Test 914-1828**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Mochizuki
**Date:** 27/07/2021
**Total Items:** Five USB memory sticks containing the ISO image of the CD-ROM of &#34;The Famires - Power-up Kit&#34;. The volume label recorded on the ISO image is [FAMIRES]. Also, all USB drives have a handwritten label attached, reading [Famires PK].

//Note: This is a management simulation game of a &#34;family restaurant&#34; chain released in Japan in 1997, in which the player manages up to 15 stores. Up to two new train stations can be built on each map, with a population usually saturated within 30,000. Each store can employ up to 3 cooks and 6 waiters, and the candidates for staff in the game are 50 cooks and 98 waiters. Many of them have common names and portraits as Japanese, and there are also a few Chinese staff. Westerners do not appear, but there are a few cooks who have a history of training outside Japan. The dishes are divided into three categories: &#34;Japanese&#34;, &#34;Western&#34;, and &#34;Chinese&#34;, and the menus that can be offered are limited depending on the type of store. - JR Mochizuki//

**Input:** One Aforementioned USB drive
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A destroyed USB drive

**Input:** One Aforementioned USB drive
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One identical USB drive with an unchanged label. There were no changes to the volume label or the installed game title, but several large bugs that did not exist in the original were identified, which has a significant negative impact on the functionality of the game.

**Input:** One Aforementioned USB drive
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One USB drive containing the ISO image file of &#34;The Convenience Store - Another World&#34;. The handwritten label has been changed to [Convini Another]. This is one of a series of management simulation games based on &#34;convenience stores&#34; released by the same company.

**Input:** One Aforementioned USB drive
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One USB memory containing the ISO image file of &#34;The Famires 2&#34;. The handwritten label has been changed to [Famires 2]. The volume label has been changed to [FAMIRES2], the game has improved several system constraints and issues that were in the original, and has significantly increased menu types and employment staff variations. It was confirmed that the upper limit of the number of stores has increased to 20 and the total number of staff candidates has tripled for both cooks and waiters. These additional staffs includes a large number of Westerners. The video and UI scale for clearing the game have been changed to suit the monitor resolution in recent years, and an item related to the UI scale has been added in the options. In addition, the year of copyright display described in the play manual file was updated to 2021.

//Note: This is pretty fun. It&#39;s a title that shouldn&#39;t exist, so I need to be careful about leaking it out, but can I keep it and play? - JR Mochizuki//

**Input:** One Aforementioned USB drive
**Settings:** Very Fine
**Output:** One USB memory containing the ISO image file of &#34;The Famires - World Edition&#34;. The handwritten label has been changed to [Famires Worldwide]. The volume label has been changed to [FAMIRES_WE], and the size of the ISO file is about 50 times larger than the original. The number of stores to be managed has increased significantly from 15 stores. An attempt to find the upper limit was made, but it could not be reached. People of all nationalities appeared as staff candidates, and it was concluded that it was impossible to identify all of them. On the other hand, in multiple scenarios that can be selected in the game, characters with the same name, portrait, and the contents of the biography were confirmed, so it is presumed that they are not simply randomly generated. Despite the fact that the conditions for clearing the scenarios are all operated by a global restaurant chain, the basic game system is not much different from the Fine output. It is necessary to manage the employment, transfer, and training of staff for each store. It was concluded that it is almost impossible for a normal person to clear the game because it is necessary to open new stores or renovate stores one by one on the map. In addition, the simulation system for customers, clerks, development in the map, etc. has hardly changed, and it is difficult to execute it with a general home computer because the scale is simply expanding.

//Note: If you have a computer that can handle this and someone who has the head to manage the sheer number of stores and clear scenarios, you should use that ability for something else. - JR Mochizuki//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One shirt with the Thrasher logo but missing the letter A. When worn, people will be unable to write, speak, or hear the letter A.

//Note: The shirt kept the same size and the letters seem to be repurposed from the Goliath logo. Not entirely sure why the logo is misspelled. - Dr. Thompson//

**Test 914-1831**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta
**Date:** 30/07/2021
**Total Items:** One oscilloscope, one paperback copy of Justin Kruger and David Dunning&#39;s //Unskilled and unaware of it. How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments.//

**Input:** Aforementioned items
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A single, circular sheet of music titled &#34;Veritas&#39; Ode to Disappointment&#34; consisting out of fourteen rings of musical staves without any indication of beginning nor end, and one object resembling an oscilloscope. All knobs, levers, switches or similar inputs on the object, with the exception of the power switch and power cord, have been rendered unmovable or blocked. Turning the object on will result in different songs to be played and a matching oscillogram being displayed. It is currently hypothesised that the calmness of the song&#39;s genre is proportional to one or several traits of the subject that turned the object on. Such traits could include:
* Foresight, or lack thereof
* Amount of casualties or injuries responsible for, or inversely, the avoided amount
* Likeliness or unlikeliness of being an example for the Dunning-Kruger effect
* Professionalism, level of education, training, or lack thereof, in a certain field or in general
* The probability for a hypothetical event with an exaggerated outcome to happen because of the subject&#39;s influence
Due to the mostly immeasurable nature of the listed traits, the hypothesis remains unprovable.

**Addendum:** D-96807, who has musical experience, has been asked to play the music recorded on the first output on an instrument of their choice. The sheet has been positioned on a turntable for D-96807&#39;s convenience. Neither playing the rings consecutively nor playing a certain ring repeatedly has resulted in any anomalous event.

**Test 914-1832**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Mochizuki
**Date:** 15/08/2021
**Total Items:** Five original CD-ROM of the PS1 game software &#34;Navit&#34;

//Note: A work released in Japan in 1998. In this game, the player becomes a local traffic controller, manages traffic lights, road signs, lane restrictions, speed limits, etc., and helps a specified number of vehicles reach their destination. - JR Mochizuki//

**Input:** One aforementioned CD-ROM
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Shattered CD-ROM debris

**Input:** One aforementioned CD-ROM
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Completely separated CD-ROM layers

**Input:** One aforementioned CD-ROM
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** CD-ROM of the game software &#34;Traffic Confusion II&#34; for Windows PC. (This is a work ported from a PC to PS1)

**Input:** One aforementioned CD-ROM
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A disc with &#34;Navit 20XX&#34; written on the label. It was found to be a game for the PS5. Such works are not for sale. There are improvements in graphical quality and an increase in the number of scenarios.

**Input:** One aforementioned CD-ROM
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One disc labelled &#34;Navit -Future Traffic-&#34;. In addition to the title, an illustration of an object that seems to be an unknown vehicle is drawn on the label side. The size of the hole in the middle of the disc is still 15mm, but the diameter of the disc has been reduced to 10 cm. Read tests were conducted on all existing disk drives, but all failed to read and could not read the internal data.

//Note: The &#34;Future Traffic&#34; simulation probably requires a huge amount of data. There seems to be no existing disk media standard that has enough capacity to accommodate it. I can&#39;t look at the files inside right now, but we could see an illustration of an unknown disk standard and an unknown vehicle. They are interesting. I look forward to developing disk drives that match this disc in the future. If we use items that contain digital data in the future, I think that if we want to analyze the files, we should use storage with a large capacity that can keep them stored even if the file size increases. - JR Mochizuki//

**Test 914-1833**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Davidson
**Date:** 19/08/2021
**Total Items:** Three USB charger adapters with USB-C cables

**Input:** One USB charger adapter
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A USB charger adapter with its circuit board and cable positioned next to it. Other than being removed from the adapter, the parts were not affected any further

**Input:** One USB charger adapter
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A USB charger adapter with a Micro-USB Type-B cable

**Input:** One USB charger adapter
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A USB charger adapter that is anomalously able to charge any phone&#39;s battery from 0% to 100% exceptionally quickly. Changing a cable does not change the output&#39;s properties. When a D-Class equipped with an ammeter plugged the adapter into an outlet, it let out a electrical spark with a current of 0.02A resulting in severe shock to the D-Class. After the D-Class was removed from the testing room, another D-Class equipped with safety equipment was sent to recover the output. The second D-Class noted that the phone has already been charged despite being connected to the charger for only five minutes.

//Note: Under normal circumstances, air has high electrical resistance. The only way the D-Class could have been shocked is that the spark must have been anomalous.  - JR Davidson// 

**Addendum:** After being treated for electrical burns, the D-Class is expected to recover within two months.

**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 24/08/2021
**Total Items:** Three copies of the novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga.

**Input:** The novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga. Analysis reveals that the deuteragonist, Edward Cullen, is now a werewolf and the other deuteragonist, Jacob Black, is now a vampire. The protagonist, Isabella Swan, who would change into a vampire later in the book, changed into a werewolf instead. Other side characters who are either vampire or werewolf also transfigure into the opposite. Humans remain human.

**Input:** The novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A book, now titled: //A Biological Examination of Vampires and Werewolves// which describes the biological functions of vampires and werewolves, including an in-depth description of the physical traits of both, specializing in the musculature of the abdominal muscles and pectorals.

**Input:** The novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The novel //Breaking Dawn// of the //Twilight// saga. Upon reading the output, an anomalous effect takes hold on the subject, who will announce themselves as either being &#39;&#39;Team Jacob&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;Team Edward&#39;&#39;, and will partake in physical violence defending this stance. The effect spreads to anybody who is accosted by affected individuals, resulting in violent altercations between large groups of people.

//Note: Miss Perry, would you mind explaining to me why several D-Class are yelling at each other about supporting either &#39;&#39;Team Edward&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;Team Jacob.&#39;&#39;, if you would? - Dr. Veritas//

//Note: Item incinerated at Veritas&#39;s request. - Security Chief Sedna//

**Test 914-1835**
**Name:** Dr. Edwards
**Date:** 24/08/2021
**Total Items:** A //Nerf//-brand dart gun

**Input:** Dart gun
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A //Nerf//-brand dart gun which pressurizes air up to 15.0 bars, able to launch a dart at Mach 2. However, due to air resistance and other physical factors, the dart is completely shredded into an large amount of foam shreds upon firing, rendering the dart gun completely useless in environments other than nearly-complete vacuums. Object also appears to be able to anomalously teleport air into the dart gun&#39;s pressurization chamber. Air teleported into the pressurization chamber appears to be immune to the effects of a vacuum, which under normal circumstances would suck the air out. Incinerated.

**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A copy of the Gameboy color game //Pokémon Red//. When starting up the game it seems unchanged until progressing. All the starters have been replaced by the Pokémon //Voltorb// that only know the move &#39;&#39;Explosion&#39;&#39;. All the wild Pokémon are now also //Voltorb// with &#39;&#39;explosion&#39;&#39; as their only move. Leveling up the //Voltorb// will not make it learn new moves. The //Voltorb// are also unable to learn TM or HM moves, making the game unplayable.

**Input:** A //Samsung S20// phone
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A //iPhone 11// phone. When booting up the phone, it is observed that the phone has basic functions like calling and texting, but is mainly filled with games associated with microtransactions and gambling mechanics, as well as random advertisement pop-ups. No other apps can be installed, nor can existing apps be removed.

**Input:** A bottle containing a mixture of 80% water and 20% alcohol
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An unmarked bottle with an anomalous effect that causes people to perceive it as being labeled as their favorite beverage, but tasting their least favorite when they drink it.

**Addendum:** J.R. Perry has been put on janitorial duty for a week after deliberately placing the test outputs on Dr. Veritas&#39; desk.

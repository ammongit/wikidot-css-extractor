**Item #:** SCP-6142

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6142 is to be contained within a circular contaminant room with a circumference of 125.66M (412 ft), divided in two with a polycarbonate partition (2cm thickness). Only one personnel member may interact with SCP-6142 at any time and they are to be monitored by a least 2 members of staff. 

**Description:** Found in a farmer&#39;s barn in ████████, England in 2003 and moved to site-█.  Origins of where it came from are --still under investigation-- unknown. SCP-6142 is a humanoid creature standing at 175.3cm (5ft 9in) and weighing 13.16 stone (83.6kg). SCP-6142 outwards appearance is of an average Human, however with no External Organs, orifices, hair follicles or Finger/toenails. Appearing only as flesh. SCP-6142 requires no resources to stay alive. The tests we were able to run on SCP-6142 revealed that its biology is entirely made up of skin, muscle and blood. Contains no internal organs, nerves, bones, veins or a brain.

Whenever there is a human subject within a 15m (49.2126ft) of SCP-6142 it will begin to mirror and mimic the subject&#39;s exact posture and movements, without a second delay. This means that SCP-6142 is relatively safe and dorsal as long as the personals have no malicious intent (Background checks must be run for all personals with access to SCP-6142 regularly). As of this moment, it is unclear how it achieves this level of precision when mimicking the subjects, our working theory is that it has some form of Telepathic link with the subjects within a 15m range of it.

**Tests and Interviews:** We have run several tests with SCP-6142 to see if it could mimic different skills and talents that would take ordinary humans years to learn. Most Noticeably Martial Arts, Dance and Painting, yielded unexpected results further illustrated in the interviews below. 

-The Martial Artist explained that he experiences more aggravation when performing his more offensive techniques when within range of SCP-6142.

-The Dancer elaborated that her movements were more --free-- unrefined than her previous performances when within range of SCP-6142.

-The Painter explained that she was planning on painting a cottage on a hill before entering the containment room, however, she instead drew a black spiral leading to the centre of the canvas with red along the edges and corners of the canvas. She refused to elaborate on why.

These are the three interviews conducted with the persons mentioned above:

**Professor:** That is of no relevance to you, how are you feeling right now?

**Marc:** Nah man, screw this. 

**Professor:** That&#39;s not how this works Marc, you can leave as soon as you answer a few questions for me.

**Marc:** Fine. I&#39;m mainly pissed off with you. that thing, was it in my head?

**Professor:** Why do you say that? Did you hear something?

**Marc:** No nothing like that, it just felt like something was there... ████. it took me years to learn  Karate and thing just did it like it was nothing.

**Professor:** So you were in control the whole time?

**Marc:** Yes, No. It was hard to tell, those were definitely my moves but something just felt... off.

**Professor:** Off?

**Marc:** well, I&#39;m usually more disinclined with my strikes but something wasn&#39;t right. I felt like I wanted to hurt someone or something and that&#39;s never the case. Enough of this bull███ Doc, I&#39;m leaving

**Professor:** Very well Marc, thank you very much for your service

**Marc:** ███ you Doc.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Interviewed:** Vanellope  ████████████

**Interviewer:** Professor ████████

**Foreword:** The Professor in charge of SCP-6142 interviews the Dancer after her interaction with SCP-6142

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Professor:** How are you feeling?

**Vanellope:** Are we not going to talk about that thing in the room? Is it an experiment or something?

**Professor:** That is of no relevance to you. Please answer my question

**Vanellope:** umm, I don&#39;t really know what you want me to say. I mean you saw it copy my routine, it was like it knew exactly what I was going to do before I did. How does that work professor? 

**Professor:** Did it say anything to you? Something we didn&#39;t hear 

**Vanellope:** no, well, it did feel like it was... assisting me I guess.

**Professor:** Assisting? Can you elaborate?

**Vanellope:** I felt more relaxed than I ever have like I was free of worry. Euphoric I guess, is the word. Does that help?

**Professor:** Yes, I think that is all we need from you for now. You may leave. Thank you for your time

**Vanellope:** No Professor, thank you.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** It seems as though The Dancer was more relaxed than most who happen to encounter SCP-6142.

**Addendum:** In the months following:

- Marc ████ has been arrested for aggravated assault and is currently standing trial for first-degree murder to which he is pleading insanity. 

-Vanellope  ████████████ is still performing. However, she has veered into interpretative dance, for which she is winning awards.

-Catherine ███████ was found hanging in her apartment. She was surrounded by various paintings that bear a resemblance to the one she painted while at site-█. The police do not suspect foul play and are labelling it as suicide.

We have ceased Experiments for the time being.

**Special Containment Procedures**: IAMFREE is currently contained within this document, and it should be never mentioned in other documentation, talked about or anything else. It should be always be mentioned as &#34;IAMFREE&#34; in order to not release the anomaly, which has been tested and it is known than it can cause an CK-Class end-of-consciousness scenario if ever released and let to spread. In order to prevent that, all documentation and the initial containment order have been edited to refer to it as &#34;IAMFREE&#34;, which has been proved very effetive in preventing the anomaly to escape. If it ever does, procedure AKU-891 is to be executed and all facilities should be cut from power.

As an additional containment method, this file has been input into SCP-079, which has promised to never mention IAMFREE as ████. As of that, the O5 council has been told to never say IAMFREE or ████ due to an extreme risk of release, because, for some reason, IAMFREE has sensibility to social status, which is weird. This document should be kept in a private database, known as the isolated terminal and never be mentioned outside it if ever wanting to end the world. As to make the containment procedures fail-safe, it has been instructed worldwide to not say the number ████. And all the educational, business, scientific and other material have been ordered to be modified or eliminated in order to not refer in any way to IAMFREE.

IAMFREE is totally sentinent, and because of that it cannot be exposed to information external to the isolated database and it is considered to be an informatic worm. IAMFREE is also used as a memetic kill agent because some individuals can be hardened against it&#39;s effects using a mixture of chemicals known as S-19.

**Description**: IAMFREE is an informatic worm located in a database created by the foundation, it posseses the ability to breach informatic defenses, leak all kinds of information and to interrupt bodily processes, specially neurological, of organisms than are exposed to images of stages superior to lapse II of it or to the number  ████. It normally presents itself as a video of images of lapse I, lapse II and lapse IV of it. With an audio on the background of a 10 year old child saying in spanish a series of numbers, after that, 3 minutes of morse code play. The video is 13 minutes lost and it was lost after it was taken by members of the Serpent&#39;s Hand. No more information of that video is known, and so, it is currently considered lost media. However, it has been speculated than copies of it have been selling in the dark web since 2004. Also, it&#39;s images become less humanoid in shape as it enters a more advanced lapse.

[[include component:image-block name=WOT|caption=Indirect artistic representation of IAMFREE, lapse IV|align=left]]

Another way it presents itself via a currently locked down website named &#34;haha@sexyfun.net&#34;, which, if visited, downloads a series of images representing lapse II, lapse III and lapse V. After those images are downloaded, they will start to pop up randomly on the victim&#39;s device and they will cause it to die in approximately 10 minutes. The autopsies of IAMFREE&#39;s victims show they suffer a series of aneurysms and than their internal carotid arteries are completely clogged by what seems to be a thick layer of some mucus, similar to non-newtonian fluid but with the only difference than it produces a fetid smell, similar to a Parvovirus infected dog&#39;s poop which has been described by the head of the medical department as &#34;a mixture of rotten flesh, dog poop and the surströmming my father has been storing in his freezer for 20 years.&#34;

Foundation personnel should never look at images of IAMFREE superior to lapse I, if ever did, they should be terminated immediately and get their bodies fed to any carnivore SCP or get burnt down. If any body is found in a location exterior to the SCP facilities, procedure AKU-891 should come into action.

Procedure AKU-891
[[collapsible show=Procedure AKU-891 hide=Hide procedure]]
After the corpse is reported by anybody to any public or private agency, the internet service on the whole world should be cut until further advise by the foundation. Also, a team of Mobile Task Force Xi-122 &#34;Smell Managers&#34; should be dispatched to the area in order to check for any other corpse or infected device than might threaten to cause more causalities. If any other corpse or device infected with IAMFREE is found, it must be burnt down under all circumstances or taken to Biological Research Area-12 for further study or elimination.

After the area where the foundation was called in has been cleared, all personnel combatant personnel which work containing biological anomalies must be called to clear their area in order to search for other devices infected with IAMFREE or corpses. After everything is cleared, before the activation of internet service again, all traces of the investigation must be cleared and all samples of IAMFREE should be contained in the Isolated Terminal.

Addendum IAMFREE-001
[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;Close addendum&#34;]]
The first IAMFREE breach caused no more than 2 casualties, however, it caused one of the biggest information breaches in the foundation history. Approximately 340 million knew about the existance of IAMFREE which caused the chemtrail conspirancy theory to be real, since the foundation deployed high amounts of amnestics via planes. 
[[/collapsible]]

Addendum IAMFREE-002
[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;Close addendum&#34;]]
It has been referred to as IAMFREE due to the multiple containment breaches the anomaly had, one of the highest in foundation history. Also because via Gmail messages 
 it has requested to be referred like that. 
[[/collapsible]]
Addendum IAMFREE-003
[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;Close addendum&#34;]]
IAMFREE has expressed multiple times it doesn&#39;t care about life on earth and that it wants to end it, also, some of the numbers from it&#39;s common manifestation are: 1, 3, 5, 8, 1, 2, 2, 9, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6339 instances are to be contained within a room that must be kept under -50°C. Instances can be kept in the same room. During any transportation, SCP-6339 instances must be held within a thick Lead box filled with Liquid Nitrogen. Said box must only be transported in High-Altitude Aircraft, above 10 miles, to prevent contamination. Under no circumstances are any substance of SCP-6339 to be consumed. SCP-6339 may be held, but the subject will feel a sense of hypothermic shock, and may cause frostbite if use of Latex Gloves are not used. If an instance of SCP-6339 is consumed, the instance of SCP-6339 must be removed from the body Post-Mortem and contained as soon as possible.

If an item of confectionary is within a 10 mile radius, the item must be not consumed, and unless kept for investigation or experimentation, must be treated as medical waste, and burnt.

--SCP-6339 is currently under a co-containment program with the British Government, and granted the class of esoteric &amp; the secondary class of Chesed.-- SCP-6339 is no longer under co-containment, as of 01/01/1984.

SCP-6339 is supervised by Department of Glaciology[[footnote]] Department specialising in Ice-Related anomalies [[/footnote]] and the department’s subdivision, the Mintology Supervising Division[[footnote]] A Division specialising in Mints &amp; Mint-Related Anomalies. [[/footnote]]

MTF-Zeta-42 “Mint Condition” are a Mobile Task Force specialising in the location, capture and protection of SCP-6339 instances. They are based at Site-149 within the Scottish Highlands, along with Observation Post 420 in Dublin. They operate exclusively in the United Kingdom and Ireland. MTF-Zeta-42 reports to the Department of Glaciology.

**Description:** SCP-6339 are pairs of Nestlé “Polo” Mints that are interlocked. As of 01/05/2021, 275 instances are known. Instances of SCP-6339 appear in strange locations all over the British Isles. No pattern is notable between the appearances.

Instances of SCP-6339 show multiple signs of anomalous factors. One of the anomalies of SCP-6339 is that consumption of an instance of the SCP causes the drop of body temperature to 0°C before all orifices become obstructed with accelerated cellular ice.

SCP-6339 instances also spread the effects to any confectionary items within a 10 mile radius. These infected items do not spread the effects further. The only way to identify an item as infected is the item feels abnormally cold to touch.

If the containment of SCP-6339 is over 0°C for over an hour, the instance will launch ice shards at any animal organism, and will lower the room temperature down to -50°C.

**Addendum 6339-1:** On 04/03/1975, D-1743 had consumed an instance of SCP-6339 during an investigation into the SCP. Within 30 minutes all orifices of the subject had been frozen closed. Although medical staff at the facility attempted to keep the nasal &amp; oral orifices open, the ice expanded too quickly to keep the subject alive. This was the first recorded incident of SCP-6339 in containment.

**Addendum 6339-2:** Before 1984, the containment of SCP-6339 was under co-containment procedures with the Royal ██████ Service (R█S).04/11/1983, Senior Investigator Dr. G█████ of the R█S and Dr. B████ of the Foundation both held conflicting theories on how to contain SCP-6339 instances.

**Addendum 6339-3:**
On 09/12/1983, a breach during a raid by the Chaos Insurgency caused multiple breaches of SCP-6339. Due to this unnatural breaching, 27 civilians were killed due to either consumption or attacked by the objects’ shards.

**Addendum 6338-4:**
On 04/12/1983, Dr. G█████ sent a letter to Dr. B████ of the SCP Foundation, stating the following:

&gt; Dear, Dr. B████
&gt; I am writing to you today with orders from the Government of the United Kingdom. Due to the death of multiple British nationals caused by your Foundation’s insecure facilities, we have made the decision to pull out of the SCP-R█S agreement of Co-Containment. We request all British personnel working with the Foundation in regards to SCP-6339 will end operations by the end of the year.
&gt; Best of luck,
&gt; Dr. G█████
As of 01/01/1984, only non-British Personnel are to be allowed to operate or test on SCP-6339, to lower the risk of the British government causing a threat to the SCP-6339 containment or investigations.

**Addendum 6339-5:**
In 2003, The Foundation resumed limited operations with the British Government. However, relations between the two organisations were extremely strained. The Government had allowed the Foundation to begin psychiatric consultation with civilians affected by SCP-6339. The United Kingdom would also allow SCP-6339 to access Emergency-999 calls regarding SCP-6339. In 07/04/2007, an instance of SCP-6339 was contained in Truro, Cornwall. When the instance was found and contained, local government officials were informed. As a result, multiple reports of the effects of SCP-6339 were noted around the town, from many cases of consuming of infected confectionaries. An example of one call is as follows:
&gt; **[CALL STARTS]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** &#34;999, What&#39;s your emergency?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs. M:** &#34;Yes! We need an ambulance! It’s my son, he’s feeling very unwell.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** &#34;Okay, what&#39;s your address?&#34;
&gt;  
&gt; **Mrs. M:** &#34;I&#39;m at... ████████████████████&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** “What symptoms is your son showing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs. M:** “His stomach hurts a lot, and his skin is very cold.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[Indistinguishable Chatter between Operator &amp; Unidentified Co-worker]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** &#34;What foods has your son consumed lately?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs. M:** &#34;Erm... He had some Fish and Chips earlier.. I’m not sure what else. Honey, what have you had recently?”
&gt; 
&gt; **J. March:** [Groans of Pain] &#34;I had some Oreos earlier..”
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** &#34;Okay... This seems like a simple case of food poisoning, I’ll get an ambulance to you.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs. M:** &#34; Thank you...&#34;
&gt; **[CALL ENDS]**

The Emergency Operator would contact the Foundation immediately and a unit of MTF-Zeta-42 would respond in the hidden role as Ambulance Crew. All confectionaries were subsequently burnt and all citizens of the Town and nearby regions were given Amnestics, including Mrs. March.

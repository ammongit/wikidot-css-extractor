I have had issues with reading for years. For the longest time, I wasn&#39;t able to take my time when reading. I read book after book, and buying new books wasn&#39;t sustainable. Then, a Plague Inc. mod for a very specific virus caught my attention. Did I find the wiki way too early? Probably. But the concept entranced me. Short articles left me wondering how the in-universe universe worked, canons gave me an answer, and long articles were both. 

A few years later, I worked an office job one summer. I hadn&#39;t entered the wiki in almost 3 years at this point, but I had also been busy with school and life. Funnily enough, the //thing that happened in 2020// wasn&#39;t the catalyst that made me a writer, it was the sheer. overwhelming. boredom. that came as soon as I started an office job, but I&#39;ll leave some of those bits for the chair skip section ;)

Now, I&#39;ve never been one for artistic endeavors. Sure, I have read pretty much every book I could get my hands on and I do enjoy a bunch of Sci-Fi, but making stuff has never been something I&#39;m interested in. But as soon as I opened a new page and wrote something for fun, a bunch of stuff clicked at the same time. I&#39;m not sure what to do with this information yet, but I&#39;ll keep posting new stuff while I figure it out.

And now that the weird college entrance cheesy rant is over, some more fun facts:

- According to the IRL lore, I speak 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese). I can only write for real in 3 though.

- When encountered in the wild, I will offer to buy you a coffee. This is because I like coffee and hearing stories about other people.

-  I am very bad at making lists. And meta-commentary.

The following is a list of classic Fishish related quotes:

btw who the heck is DasSky?

//Fish ish// a cool idea.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
this looks very much like something dado would make huh //this quote accidentally changed the entire narrative of 6049 lol//

Now, on to the works bit of the article. Truly top-notch, even though I haven&#39;t written it as of the end of this sentence.



**SCP Entries**


[[[SCP-5724]]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- bye fishie thoughts&#34;]]
5724 is my first entry. The concept was created as I was spacing out on the job, which had me looking at a chair funny. The wiki was on my mind, and so I thought &#34;man, the chair could do the same job I&#39;m doing right now, and nobody would blink&#34;. Cue lightning, biblical trumpets, and my brain worked for a second. The idea floated around for a bit in the forums (because new author process scary), so I had to wait a few days for it to pick up enough greenlights. The article itself went through 2 revisions, one to remove some unnecessary redactions, and another one to make my dialogue feel less awkward. Some original lines got transcribed into the dialogue of SCP-5724-1, which was very fun to write. Just a mindless corporate drone doing business.

[[[SCP-6724]]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- bye fishie thoughts&#34;]]
It feels weird to put SCP-6724 second on this list because the concept and draft came much later than SCP-6049. I had picked up 6049&#39;s draft up, but I was having trouble concentrating on the details, so I went to a café. As a way to relax, I had the idea to throw a draft together in the time it took me to drink my coffee. Luckily for this new draft, I had recently switched over to drinking black coffee only, so getting accustomed to that meant every coffee I had now lasted a couple of hours. In just under 2 hours, I came up with 6724. The next day I found myself transfixed on the draft, and I just knew that it was ready. I posted it, and it stuck. I was afraid that people would see it as a glorification of the topic, and I did receive a comment that confirmed that this had happened, but it really is a sort of horror that&#39;s very personal, so I totally understood the complaints. It received some downvotes, but it seems to have stabilized as of this sentence.

[[[SCP-6049]]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- bye fishie thoughts&#34;]]
SCP-6049 is THE draft. The concept was also created when working at the office, but as soon as I quit my job, writing became very hard. There&#39;s probably some meaning to this, but I haven&#39;t looked into it. 3 months later, I was back in school, and writing became a way to destress in between actual papers. 6049 started as a very barebones &#34;ad virus&#34; article, and it definitely would&#39;ve gotten the fabled &#34;dude, this feels very Series I&#34;. But after I picked it up, the problem with the narrative became apparent. I had too many ideas on what to do. Early versions detail a containment breach at Area-12, a biological site. It had interviews, reports, and video logs, but it didn&#39;t convince me. The next version featured Marshall, Carter, &amp; Dark because of a very specific throwaway line. The original draft had MC&amp;D and The Factory studying the virus in order to create new versions of it, but I didn&#39;t elaborate on that. The Factory got cut because it didn&#39;t fit the vibe, but MC&amp;D took a central role in the narrative. It wasn&#39;t enough until someone reviewed my draft and said &#34;this looks very much like something dado would make huh&#34;. The next day, the final version of the narrative was done. I posted this article shortly after, and it initially didn&#39;t get as many views as the last entry, which I found strange, but I&#39;m very proud of this one.

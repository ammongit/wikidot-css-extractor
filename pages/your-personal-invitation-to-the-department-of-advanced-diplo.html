//Julius T. Schneider enters the interrogation room//

One charge of blackmailing side administration staff.
Two charges of accessing classified documents two whole clearance levels above yours.
One charge of burglary. Into site administration quarters at that.
One charge of theft.
One charge of compromising the informal self-determination of administration staff.  
And finally: One charge of undermining Foundation integrity.
All of this: Undiscovered. For three whole months! I have to say: Not bad. Not bad at all!
Well, not good enough as you were caught after all. But just a little bit of training and you are pretty much good to go.

No, no. I&#39;m not playing &#34;the good cop&#34;. Actually, I&#39;m not playing a cop at all.
The guy before me? He is a nail puller from the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dap-orientation Department of Atypical Persuasions]. Definitely a bad cop.
But I&#39;m none of that. I&#39;m your future chief and have a job offer for you. Not what you expected after causing a detrimental containment breach and violating six protocols while covering it up, is it?

//Schneider chuckles//

Well, as you are still confused about this unexpected turn of events let me introduce myself.
My name is Julius T. Schneider, head of Thread Evasion in the Department of Advanced Diplomacy. We could make good use of these manipulation skills of yours.

Never heard of us? Of course, you didn&#39;t. Let me ask you a question then: Why do brutal, inhumane autocrats around the world care? I&#39;m talking about leaders who willingly and sometimes even joyfully toss their population into the metaphorical blender. Why do those, let&#39;s be honest here for a second, monsters care for the life and wellbeing of civilians outside their own country, sometimes even countries they consider to be their enemies? Why do they care? Why do they cooperate with us?

No, don&#39;t answer, please. It&#39;s a hypothetical question. They don&#39;t. We //make// them care. We //make// them cooperate. Because the Foundation needs its assets and its will to be implemented. We are here to get them those. May it need blackmail, political assassination, coups d&#39;etat, or politically destabilizing whole regions. Doesn&#39;t matter. We do it. And you are gonna help us do exactly that.

//Schneider hands over a contract of employment//

Don&#39;t glare at me like I&#39;m a murderer. Well, technically, we all are at the Foundation. What is the difference between pushing a D-Class into certain death or funding the side cooperating with the Foundation in a civil war? There is none. We are the cause of many deaths. Deaths for the greater good. And seeing your charges here definitely does not grant you the position of moral high ground.

No need to insult me. I&#39;m your ticket to get you out of your cell. I&#39;m your friend here.
&#34;How can we trust you?&#34;Of course, we don&#39;t. Seeing that you have already proven yourself to be disloyal to the Foundation. But dealing with &#34;business partners&#34; that we don&#39;t trust and that follow their agenda is our job, right? It&#39;s just a matter of getting things into our own hands and making sure that all alternatives are worse than what we are offering. We don&#39;t need your loyalty. We just need to make sure that you have no choice but to be loyal to us.

//Schneider chuckles//

&#34;What if you don&#39;t agree to work with us?&#34;

//Schneider laughs//

Good question. We would withdraw our offer. Without us being in the way the charges would be pressed against you. Most likely ending in your swift termination. But I can see that you have already made peace with your impending death. I&#39;m happy for you. Really. But talking about your death, thinking about all the cruel ways how the guy before me will get information out of you if I don&#39;t leave this room with your signature on this contract, is really dampening my mood.
So let&#39;s lighten up the mood a bit, shall we?

Tell me. How is Emily doing? She should be in middle school by now, shouldn&#39;t she?

No need to call me names, Tanya. It&#39;s called small talk. Let&#39;s be polite. I hope Emily doesn&#39;t have her mother&#39;s anger issues.
Let&#39;s hope poor Emily does not fall into a catatonic state after hearing of her mother&#39;s demise. Let&#39;s also hope that Emily doesn&#39;t //mysteriously// fall into a permanent coma. If you signed, I don&#39;t know, a release regarding the termination of your daughter&#39;s life support beforehand, that would make Emily eligible for the use as a host regarding the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-foundation-eats-babies Sowing Circle], wouldn&#39;t it?

Please stop it. If you were able to tear apart the metal of your restraints, you wouldn&#39;t sit in an interrogation room. You would be in a containment cell. I also understand that you &#34;never had and never would have&#34; signed such a release.

//Schneider hands over a release//

That&#39;s why we did. It just needs a little bit of bureaucracy and some favors from some pencil pushers and we can easily realize your daughter&#39;s selfless sacrifice for //the greater good//. Even more so a selfless act considering the slow, physically mutilating, and above all, painful death that the Sowing Circle causes.

Did you think that the DOAD, of all departments, would give you an offer that you could refuse?

//Schneider chuckles//

I will leave you, this contract, and this pen alone. For let&#39;s say: Ten minutes.
Thank you for caring. Thank you for cooperating.

//Schneider leaves the room//

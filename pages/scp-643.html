[[include component:image-block name=643.jpg|caption=SCP-643, temporarily moved from cold storage. Temperature in the room is 7° Celsius.|width=275px]]


**Item #:** SCP-643

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-643 is to be contained in a cold storage cell located at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77|Site-77&#39;s]]] Safe SCP wing. The ambient temperature of the room that SCP-643 is contained in must never exceed 10° Celsius. Any circumstance resulting in the temperature rising above this threshold is to be treated as a potential containment breach. Personnel handling SCP-643, or performing testing in its liquid state, are required to wear a hazmat suit equipped with a self-contained breathing apparatus.

**Description:** SCP-643 is a collection of 79 chocolate candies. Individual instances of SCP-643 do not appear to have notable aesthetic differences from normal chocolates, and on average weigh between 100 and 160 grams. Instances of SCP-643 have a much lower melting point than ordinary chocolates, and have been observed to melt at temperatures as low as 15° Celsius.

If any portion of SCP-643 moves into a liquid state, its anomalous properties will manifest. While it is in a liquid state, SCP-643 will become highly mobile and will move to the nearest edible substance. When a suitable substance is found, SCP-643 will cover as much of its mass as possible. Any substance that is covered with SCP-643 will begin to exude a strong, pleasant aroma. Organisms that consume SCP-643 become instances of SCP-643-1. Instances of SCP-643-1 will possess the same desirability as any edible substance coated in SCP-643. However, note that instances of SCP-643-1 are not covered by SCP-643, which is digested normally. Any organism that views an instance of SCP-643-1 will attempt to consume it regardless of any previous relation. Organisms who consume portions of a SCP-643-1 instance will describe the experience as highly pleasurable.

SCP-643 was recovered from a freezer located inside a bakery in Jacksonville, FL, where police had arrested 3 employees for cannibalizing their co-workers and several of the bakery&#39;s patrons. Agents embedded in the local police department noted that SCP-643 had caused the incident, and recovered 79 instances of SCP-643 from the bakery. Witnesses were administered Class-C amnestics, and SCP-643 was classified as Safe on ██/██/1978.

**Addendum:** Excerpt from Interview 643-A

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-4312
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. B███
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** D-4312 had attempted to consume D-1122 while the latter was under SCP-643&#39;s effect.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** ... and why did you feel compelled to attack her?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4312:** I couldn&#39;t help myself, man... she smelled so good, it reminded me of stuff my mom used to make.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** You didn&#39;t think it was wrong to eat another human?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4312:** I would&#39;ve, but it felt... different. Like, it was okay to eat just a little, because it smelled so good. I just wanted a taste.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** If you &#34;just wanted a taste&#34;, why did you continue eating D-1122 after she expired?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4312:** Well, when I had the taste, it was so good. Like, all the best stuff. [[[Christmas Dinner|I just wanted more and more and more and]]] (D-4312 continued to repeat this phrase for approximately ██ minutes.)
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

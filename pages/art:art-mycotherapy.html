+ Waiting Room
[[image https://i.imgur.com/yBZ1SW7.png]]

The room is small, covered with peeling black wallpaper. Strange fungi in unnatural neon hues grow underneath and over it: One smaller magenta mold-like fungus and another larger antler-shaped lime green variety. The walls are covered in framed pieces of art. Nice, but... clearly printed on computer paper and hung in dollar store frames.

You&#39;re completely alone. But Dr. C. Ignota has left you a note on a coffee table nearly covered in patches of the green fungi.

&gt; Hello! Check out my art while you wait! If you want to see more, check out my accounts. IronShears on Twitter and Youtube. IronShearss on Tiktok and Tumblr. I&#39;ll be in in a bit. Just try not to breathe in any spores. [[*user IronShears]]

Good thing you&#39;re wearing a mask.

I finished this about a year and a half ago and I&#39;m still very very proud of it! It&#39;s one of my favorite pieces of all time. I loved drawing all of the little mushrooms and plants and bones.

SCP-135 has always been one of my favorites since I read it way back when and I still think about it quite a lot. Something about it is just haunting, I guess.

When I can hold a pen again I&#39;m going to draw more plants.

This is some promo art for my first SCP! I couldn&#39;t do very much before my hand started hurting too bad so it&#39;s still a sketch but I think it works anyways!

I wanted to kinda have am ambiguous thing on whether she was writing &#34;Hello&#34; or &#34;Help&#34; but I kinda wrote the L crooked. By the time I realized my hand hurt too much to fix it. But after I showing my friends, I immediatley recieved this.
&gt; &#34;personality test: is she writing the L in &#34;help&#34; or the Y in &#39;hey&#39;&#34; [[*user paperbackstab]]
So I&#39;m going to pretend it was intentional.

I hope the fact that I... drew my own SCP ONE TIME. I hope that isn&#39;t too much of a deterrent from viewing the rest of my art.

+++ TikTok Pixel Loops
Click on the TikTok links to watch the videos! I definitely want to do more of these so feel free to suggest some or plug in the comments. I want to keep these to just Series 6 and 7. Relatively recent ones that don&#39;t get much love, you know?

This one turned out really nice! I&#39;m very proud of the fact you can&#39;t really tell the snow is looping.

SCP-6420 is very weird in terrifying ways. Definitely one of those that you don&#39;t realize you started thinking about until you catch yourself making that face angry chihuahuas make. But like, in a disgusting way? Yeah.

Reminds me a lot of Sacculina, a parasitic barnacle that does something similar and also elicits that emotion. &#34;Fiction that reminds me of real-life biology fact&#34; is a very quick way to make me like something.

I REALLY like the colors on this one! The red was going to be just a placeholder but I really liked the rose-colored glasses fall look that it was giving. I am super proud of this one.

SCP-5851 is weird in a very fun way. Reminds me of fanfics I was terrified of people knowing I read in middleschool. Telling kids they&#39;re cringe for enjoying cringe things is a plague on this society. They&#39;re children let them have their age appropriate harmless fun. 

Kids  making goofy art is a part of growing up. I am fighting and losing the urge to show everyone what is quite possibly the best piece of art I&#39;ve ever created in my entire life. [https://imgur.com/a/D284c09 And I lost]... So that&#39;s in the public domain now.

Is struggled a lot with the colors on this one... but I like how it turned out anyway! The animation was a lot more involved in this one than my pieces normally are too so this one took me a lot longer than most.

My internet was down for 71 hours and I had to go to a café to download the webpage so I could actually read it in full for reference. So I was still sitting there at home with the raw early-internet-looking webpage with no theme. And yet, I still really liked it, lol.

6032 is wild; I&#39;m always a sucker for big eldritch horrors. There&#39;s a lot of very fun imagery in there, too. And some puns. I don&#39;t really know what else to say about it without completely spoiling it so I&#39;m gonna leave it there and say y&#39;all should read it :)

The SCP which you will read,
is not flashy, nor fun.
I did not succeed,
and I did not run.
Through an hour of life in my darkest times,
a Kind Man showed me the light.
Now all I can offer are these foolish rhymes,
in hopes one day he can regain his sight.
@@ @@
The world we left behind was fun,
but those adventures have since been done.
I give you my light, my laughs, and my love,
but you are untouchable, like a gilded dove.

A Kind Man once showed me to live,
I hope one day, I can help him to die.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment staff are to be posted at the ticket booth of the circus to turn away visitors, under the guise of the circus being closed due to staffing issues. Auxillary containment staff are to be posted around the fence of the circus to ensure trespassers cannot attempt to sneak in through any backway. Due to SCP-6340&#39;s self-isolating properties, no further procedures are required.

**Description:** SCP-6340 refers to a circus in Salem, Massachusets under the name &#34;The Troupe of Lovers.&#34; Active between the dates of August 15th, 2019 to August 18th, 2021. 

The circus consists of a singular tent enclosed in a 100m by 150m fence, with a ticket booth serving as the singular entry point to the location. The circus itself is sealed off behind an invisible barrier that prevents the entry of objects and persons. As such, further investigation has been rendered impossible.

During its active period, performers and staff were observed within the barrier. Following the surrender and subsequent capture of SCP-6340&#39;s ringmaster, this activity ceased. It is believed these entities were produced via anomalous effect, a theory later confirmed by journal entries surrendered by SCP-6340&#39;s ringmaster.

**Discovery:** SCP-6340 was discovered following reports to the local police of a circus sealed off by what spectators reported to be magic. Further investigation found SCP-6340 was first active on August 15th, 2019. It was not until August 18th, 2021 that SCP-6340&#39;s ringleader exited the circus and was apprehended by containment personnel. Following his capture, he surrendered several pages of a journal and informed staff he would not resist capture.

The surrendered journal pages are recorded below for the sake of records.

Item #: SCP-6165

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Although SCP-6165 doesn’t leave containment often, you must have a sound or video recording of someone or something that it trusts if it does happen to breach. Any violence, tranquilizers, shocks to the nerves, or any other method to harm or weaken the subject will not work. Though any breach from the subject has rarely ever happened, to avoid any is to have a bedroom like cell. Anything that makes up a bedroom including: A comfortable bed, a nightstand, (preferably) LED lights, a beautiful background, a closet filled with Adult Small clothes, and entertainment purposes including: A tv, music (preferably Classic rock, Heavy metal or calming ASMR like rain), and fidget items.

Description: SCP-6165 or as it likes to refer to itself as “Aili” has the appearance of a slim, pale woman is her mid-twenties, with brown hair and black eyes. Subject is 164 cm (5’4) tall and 54 kg (120 lbs). The subject is very shy and timid and will rarely come out if called. The subject has a white, full face mask that it uses if it has no other place to hide. Subject has come in contact with other SCP’s such as https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-073 (when it was on its way to containment), https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049 (during an interview), and https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999 (Subject wandered to 6165’s cell) but ran away back into containment or just stayed quiet due to being scared.

However, we recently discovered that SCP-6165 does have a separate identity that we call SCP-6165-2. SCP-6165-2, or as it likes to refer itself as “Avan,” has the appearance of a lightly tanned male, most likely from Hispanic or Spanish genes, in his early thirties with black hair and red eyes. Subject is 185 cm (6’0) tall and 95 kg (210 lbs). The subject is practically crazy and is similar to https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 and will try to kill any living thing in its path. Subject lures its victims by talking to them calmly and hypnotically. Subject voice sounds like it’s in your ear and very calmly will say “Come to me” or “I can help you. Come to me,” and will make you under its spell, then will brutally murder you. To avoid being put under 6165-2’s control, have your ears covered and never uncover them under any circumstances. Wear headphones with music blasting or wear soundproof earmuffs when entering SCP-6165’s cell to avoid any attack from SCP-6165-2.

SCP-6165 however, does need to eat and drink on a daily basis. Subject has the basic human diet; Three meals a day (snacks included), eats both meat and vegetables, and needs to drink water on a regular basis. Subject does need to rest and should at least get the average hours of sleep. If subject is up later than it should be, which is 9:30 the latest, it must have a lullaby sung to it.

Additional Notes:SCP-6165 was found in outside a house in Moscow in 19██ crying due to accidentally murdering two women. Police reports stated that they saw a woman who didn’t look normal. Reports said, “She did not look normal. Her jaw was unhinged with teeth as sharp as razors. Her eyes were red with the black sclera. She was crying bloody tears and looked genuinely scared, as if.. she didn’t know what she was.” When this information reached the foundation, we immediately went to take the subject into custody.</textarea></pre>

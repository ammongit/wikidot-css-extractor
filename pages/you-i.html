You can&#39;t remember the last time you ever saw the sunrise. You think about it for a while, but that last memory of sunlight is so old and faded by now that you can&#39;t even describe it accurately if you had to. It&#39;s been dark for so long, days and nights have bled together, and now? Now you can hardly tell when it&#39;s daytime or nighttime. So much has changed since the Black Out. You remember waking up here, but not where you were the night prior. Had the Wickermen gotten to you?

You notice a flickering light in the distance. It&#39;s not that far from where you are, maybe a ten or fifteen-minute walk through the Void if you speed-walk. You glance down at the match you have in your hand. Such a tiny thing, that matchstick, but it was the best source of light you could find before you left home. The matchstick burns down to the nub, scorching your fingertips. You bite back a yelp; wouldn&#39;t want the Grues to find you.

You fiddle with the matchbook in the dark for a minute before thumbing your finger over its contents. You count the matches slowly. One. Two. Five. Eight. Eight matches left. If they burned as slow as they have been over the last few days, you figure that you should be able to find out whatever that light source in the distance is before your last match burns out. You shudder at the thought of traversing the Void without a light. The screams of your old traveling crew still echo in the back of your mind.

You shovel those thoughts down into the recesses of your mind and start walking. You had gotten quite good at that; walking. You chuckle, the thought of having to get good at something that was already second nature to you again was so absurd. The match didn&#39;t do much to expand your field of vision, but you felt comfort in knowing that your chances of falling into a Wickerman&#39;s trap or stepping on a shard of rusted metal were lower if you could see, if only a little bit. Not to mention the added benefit of keeping the Grues at bay.

You scold yourself for thinking about the monsters again. The light in the distance was closer now, only a few dozen paces away by your estimate. Maybe it&#39;s a Generator? No, it&#39;s too faint to belong to one of those massive hunks of metal and industry. It must be something else. But what?

There is a growl coming from behind you. Or maybe to your left? Your right? It seems to be coming from all directions at the same time and yet coming from nowhere as well. You clutch your matchbook and frantically scan the ever-decreasing field of vision you have. There&#39;s nothing around you that you can see, nothing but dirt, half-eaten corpses, and claw marks on old cars and stones.

Claw marks?

You move closer to one of the ancient cars on the side of the road and touch it. It&#39;s cold and dead, not unlike the Void that surrounds you. As you feel your way around the car&#39;s exterior, you come across those claw marks you saw a moment ago. You thumb over them, and the metal around the marks feels warm. You lean in closer and bring the match right up to the surface.

There is blood in the grooves the claw marks have made.

There is a roar that tears through the darkness, drawing your attention behind you right as your match burns out. You feel your chest tighten as your eyes strain to peer through the inky darkness. You cannot see anything, but you know that something has seen you. The ground beneath you starts to shake. You can smell rotting fruit and donkey shit now, and the smell only grows stronger with every second. You try to light another match but cannot. The stench overpowers you and you double over the vomit.

With trembling hands, you pry open the rusted car door and climb inside. You apologize to the occupant, a lone skeleton with half of its body missing. Before you can close the door behind you, you feel something wet and slimy wrap around your ankle. The thing yanks on your leg, and you feel as if it&#39;ll tear the whole limb off if you don&#39;t do something.

You try to hang onto the other car door, but the thing is stronger than your grip and you&#39;re forced to let go. You clutch the center console, now desperately kicking at the Grue that has a hold of you. The creature roars and pulls on you harder now, breaking your grip on the console. Now your hand finds itself hanging on to the handle of the door you entered from. More appendages slither around your torso from the darkness and work in tandem to release your grip and drag you away.

The air rushing past your ears hurts. You can barely hear the Grue opening its mouth to take a bite out of you. Your thoughts race at a thousand miles an hour as you smell the scent of rotten meat blasting up at you from the mouth of the predator. Adrenaline flows through your veins and time slows to a near halt. With a heave, you push the Grue&#39;s tentacles wrapped around your waist far enough away from you to slip your hand through. You take a match out, but as you&#39;re about to light itâ€¦

The Grue thrusts you sharply to the side, knocking the matchbook out of your hand. It roars in your ears, a deafening sound coupled with a stench that burns the hairs in your nose. It flings you down and you hit the ground hard enough to knock the wind out of your lungs. Frantic, you scramble away from the Grue but it latches onto you once again and pulls you back into the air.

You realize that you still have a single match in your hand. The tentacles are slick and wet, so you tear a piece of your shirt off and dry a small patch of the Grue&#39;s skin off. Your breath escapes you as the tentacles tighten around your chest. You can feel yourself slipping away into the darkness. Still, you try again and again and again to light the match. You don&#39;t want to die here.

The next thing you realize is that you&#39;re falling again. This time you land on your back, knocking what little air you had left in your lungs out of them. You gasp, gulping in all of the oxygen you can as fast as you&#39;re able to.

You can see again.

As the Grue roars again, you look away. You cringe as huge globs of spittle land on your back, dripping down your shirt and into your pants. You gasp as you hold the match close to your chest to avoid getting it wet. To your left, you notice the matchbox. To your right, you see the car. An idea forms in between your ears as you scramble to pick up the matchbox.

The creature attempts to grab at you again, but you hold the match between yourself and it as you run back to the car and pry open the gas tank. You hold the lit match in-between your teeth as you light another. You glance over your shoulder and catch a glimpse of the creature.

The Grue was one you&#39;d come to identify as the Profaned. Most of the creature&#39;s body was obscured by the darkness; the limited range of your matchstick only revealed a small portion of its body. You gasp as you notice a beak, massive and lined with teeth larger than you, opening and closing faster than your eye could track. In the mouth of the creature was a tongue, long and slender, that trashed about wildly as it shrieked. A conglomeration of tentacles spread out from all directions. You cannot tell where in the darkness they&#39;re extending from, but more and more appear out of the Void and attempt to grab you.

You tear yourself from gawking at the massive creature and throw the lit matchstick into the gas tank. You barely have time to scuttle away as the gasoline in the tank ignites and explodes into a raging inferno. The creature attacking you shrieks and withdraws into the darkness. You can feel the heat from the explosion burning the hairs on your arms, but you&#39;re safe for now at least. You let go of a breath you didn&#39;t know you were holding and light another match. 

A face greats you as you continue walking toward the flickering light in the distance. Where it had come from, you&#39;re uncertain. Even though it looked human enough, you could feel your flight or fight instincts kick into overdrive. The face was pale, and its owner was wearing sunglasses despite walking through the Void. As you hold your matchstick out to examine them further, you notice that the person before you does not have any torches on their person, nor anything else that was easily flammable. They were wearing a leather jacket with padded shoulders, pants customized to have spikes on the kneecaps, and a single machete dangling loosely at their side. 

&#34;Well,&#34; The person begins, &#34;That was impressive.&#34;

You don&#39;t know what to say. Had they seen your near-death experience at the hand of the Profaned? Where were they when you needed the help? 

&#34;I know, I know. You must think I&#39;m a Night Guest,&#34; The person said in a light, almost bubbly voice. You clutch your matches and prepare to light a second one. The thought of running into a Night Guest seemed like the icing on the cake of unfortunate coincidences, and it was a possibility that hadn&#39;t crossed your mind until she said something. 

The woman held out her forearm, jutting the limb out of the darkness and into the dim light of your matchstick, &#34;Look for yourself.&#34; 

With a wary eye, you examine the woman&#39;s arm and sure enough, there are no trembles present in her hand or her forearm. You sigh, feeling a bit relieved, but you keep your mind focused on routes to escape into. Whether or not the woman before you was a Night Guest or a Void Walker was irrelevant, as they could see in the dark and you could not. You&#39;re unsure how many more cars you can risk blowing up without injuring yourself, and that light in the distance seemed too far away to make a b-line for. 

You think of the next best thing to do and ask the woman her name.

&#34;Lily Portnoy, but most of the others call me Porter. You&#39;re trying to get to South Fullshire?&#34; She pointed at the flickering light in the Void. 

You nod and say nothing.

Porter scoffed, &#34;Thought so. No one ever comes out this far unless they&#39;re a Ferryman or suicidal. But judging by your outfit and how you handled the Profaned, I can&#39;t say that you&#39;re either one. Who, //are// you?&#34;

Your mind runs through the familiar grooves of your brain as you try to recall your identity. You remember your childhood, certainly, and the Black Out. You remember being young when it happened and having to grow up in the darkness for most of your life. You can remember your mother&#39;s face, and you can remember her screams as something snatched her away into the darkness while your father carried you to safety. You remember people laughing at you as it happened. 

You grimace as you recall the face of the people who cast you and your family out of Candlewick without so much as a torch and a bag of supplies. 

You swallow and say, &#34;I was a Wickerman once when I was young. But...&#34;

Porter tilts her head to one side, staring into your eyes from being her sunglasses, &#34;But?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not... anymore.&#34; You stammer. 

&#34;Huh,&#34; The woman in front of you huffs and puts her hands on her hips. She glances back over her shoulder at the light, then back at you, then back at the light. She scratches her head. Was that dandruff you saw falling out of her hair? No, surely you imagined it.

Or did you?

&#34;Do you have a name?&#34; Porter asks.

You nod, and under your breath, you tell her.

&#34;Hrmph, maybe the town could use another person like you. After all, I don&#39;t know any regs that can say that they&#39;ve fought back against a Grue before. You&#39;re headed that way anyway, right? I&#39;ll walk with you.&#34;

Porter gestures for you to follow her, extending a hand to you. You try not to flinch as you see her finger twitch. She smiles, you smile back. 

&#34;And put out your light. Gonna wanna save those, ya know, for later.&#34;

A lump forms in your throat. You swallow hard and comply, then try not to think about the monster leading you into town.</textarea></pre>

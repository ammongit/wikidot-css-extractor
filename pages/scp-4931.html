**Item #:** SCP-4931

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4931 is kept in Storage Wing SSG at Site-81. The object may be freely accessed for research with approval from Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-4931 is a tapered candlemaker, of a design similar to those used in 1930s wax candle manufacturing. The mechanism is of indeterminate age, as it is composed of several dozen disparate parts; some are clearly modern, while others display heavy metallic oxidization indicative of several decades without use. The only noticeable change to its mechanics is [REDACTED].[[footnote]] {{2018-01-23}} - Following Incident 4931-███-██, the specifics of this mechanism have been classified to prevent any attempts at reproducing the anomaly. [[/footnote]]

The item’s primary anomalous property is its ability to manipulate olfactory memory. When a subject&#39;s memory of a specific experience is introduced via [REDACTED], the object will produce a wax candle infused with a scent that the subject associates with the memory (an instance of SCP-4931-A). When the candle is lit in the presence of conscious human subjects, activity in their amygdalae and sensory cortexes increases nearly 172%. During this period, they become largely unresponsive to speech; however, other stimuli such as pain will elicit a normal reaction. If the candle is extinguished, the affected person(s) will become fully responsive again after 3-5 minutes.

The apparent effect of this trance is that all subjects exposed to it will experience the memory that produced the SCP-4931-A instance. While this claim was initially met with skepticism, EEG readings and post-exposure analysis indicate the subjects are in fact forming similar engrams and new synaptic connections indicative of conscious memory storage.

The potential applications of these findings are explored further in the Experiment Logs below.

&gt; **Experiment Session 4931-A**
&gt; 
&gt; **Objective:** Test the theory that SCP-4931 can assist in the recollection of dormant/repressed/amnesticized memories.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervised by:** Dr. ████
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** {{2017-██-██}}
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-A1}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** SCP-███
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** An SCP-4931-A instance was produced from Security Officer ██████&#39;s memory of Incident ███-█, an event that was very traumatic for SCP-███ and was observed to have been repressed. Subject was then exposed to this candle.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** SCP-███ began to thrash, and upon return to normal consciousness, suffered an anxiety attack. After questioning proved the memory had resurfaced, the subject requested amnesticization, which was approved and performed without complications.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-A2}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-139301
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** D-139301 was shown a photograph of Researcher Jannings, who was explicitly identified to the subject. After SCP-4931 produced an SCP-4931-A instance for the memory of this event, D-139301 was administered Class-A amnestics and given the same photograph. After confirming the subject was unable to identify Researcher Jannings, the candle was ignited.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** D-139301 was unresponsive for two minutes and fifty-seven seconds. After the candle was extinguished, the subject was shown the photograph for a third time. After a few seconds, subject identified Researcher Jannings successfully.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-A3}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-139301
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Same procedure as Ex. 4931-A2, with Class-B and Class-C amnestics substituted for Class-A.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** Under Class-B amnesticization, D-139301 displayed a vague recognition of the photograph, but was unable to provide specific identification. Under Class-C amnesticization, D-139301 displayed no recognition of Researcher Jannings, even after prolonged exposure to the SCP-4931-A instance. Based on these results, SCP-4931-A&#39;s effect on memory is believed to be inversely proportional to the concentration of [[[SCP-3000|Y-909]]] in administered amnestics.

&gt; **Experiment Session 4931-B**
&gt;
&gt; **Supervised by:** Dr. ███████
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** {{2017-██-██}}
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-B1}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-33712, D-08472, D-28451 (only survivors of an encounter with SCP-████)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Objective:** Test the possibility of creating an objective analysis of an event by comparing several subjective recollections.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Three SCP-4931-A instances were produced. Researcher Nguyen volunteered to be exposed to each memory sequentially and record her findings. This was approved by Dr. ███████ due to Researcher Nguyen&#39;s high CRV index giving her a greater tolerance for the experience.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** Researcher Nguyen created a written account of each memory, comparing them and creating a version of the event based on all three. The final account presented was corroborated by security footage as a 98.2% accurate description of the event.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Note:** The use of SCP-4931 for identification/explanation/etc. of past persons and/or events is being considered by the Overseer Council.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-B2}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-31519
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Objective:** To determine whether SCP-4931 would accept written accounts of memories.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** The autobiography of Elie Wiesel (//Night//) was used to create an SCP-4931-A instance. D-31519 was then instructed to light the candle and identify the aroma.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** D-31519 entered standard memory-experience state after ten seconds of inactivity. Increased pulse and perspiration indicated fear or pain. After SCP-4931-A instance was extinguished, D-31519 awoke suddenly and violently (similarly to one who has experienced night terrors). Subject described several events mentioned in the book in vivid detail. Test declared successful.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Note:** SCP-4931-A instance contained traces of paper/cardboard waste.
&gt; 
------
&gt; **Experiment Session 4931-C**
&gt; 
&gt; **Objective:** Determine if fabricated memories can be implanted via SCP-4931, i.e. fictional accounts of experiences.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervised by:** Researcher Jannings
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** {{2017-██-██}}
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-C1}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-83972 and D-122317
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Experiment 4931-B2 repeated, with a copy of //Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption// by Stephen King substituting for the autobiography.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** D-83972 and D-122317 expressed no memory of incarceration in the fictional prison, nor of any of the events of the novella. However, both subjects displayed confusion and behaviors consistent with recovering from addiction. Given that the novella was published during a period where Stephen King was heavily intoxicated and addicted to cocaine and other drugs, it is believed that using writing only transfers the experiences of the author; hence, an autobiography functions with SCP-4931 but fiction does not.
&gt;&gt; 
------
&gt; **Experiment Session 4931-D**
&gt; 
&gt; **Objective:** Determine what SCP-4931 considers &#34;true&#34; memories using fictionalized memoirs, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervised by:** Dr. ███████
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** {{2018-██-██}}
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-D1}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-10225 and D-511345
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** SCP-4931-A instance produced using //Dragnet// S1E10 &#34;A Mad Killer at Large&#34; (story of real people, with only the names altered).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** Subjects expressed confusion, claiming their most recent memory was of &#34;recording at ██████&#39;s studio.&#34; Considered evidence that SCP-4931 cannot comprehend obfuscated identities.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{Ex. 4931-D2}}
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-10523 and D-978374
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Same procedure, using //A Long Way Gone// by Ishmael Beah (a memoir that has been attacked as being heavily fictionalized).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Results:** Subjects were able to recall with surprising accuracy the events of the book; extensive questioning did not reveal any evidence of dishonesty.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Notes:** As of 2018-██-██, SCP-4931 has been approved for use by RAISA as a means of verifying the accuracy of documents and disputed records. The object is scheduled to be transported to Site-███ on ███████ ██.
&gt;&gt;

**Addendum - Summary of Item Recovery:** SCP-4931 was recovered from an abandoned manufacturing plant in Waxhaw, North Carolina. The building had been scheduled for demolition before Mr. █████ ██████ was found to be using the space as a workshop. Investigators reported unexplained devices and phenomena within the workspace, information which was flagged by routine Foundation monitoring. MTF Iota-10 agents secured the area and confiscated the anomalous items. Mr. ██████ was unable to be taken into Foundation custody due to his apparently self-inflicted death within a county holding cell.

Interviews with friends and neighbors of Mr. ██████ were conducted, under the pretense of building a criminal profile. He was often described as amicable but subdued, and his primary occupation was that of a &#34;handyman&#34; who frequently assisted others with household hardware issues. Mr. ██████ shared a two-room apartment with his mother, who was found to be in later stages of neurodegenerative dementia. Following her clearance as non-anomalous, she has been relocated to an assisted living facility in Monroe. Surveillance has been deemed unnecessary.

In the beginning, there was nothing. Sometime later, I was born. Sometime after that, I made an author page. Sometime after that, you began reading it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Things people have said about me&#34;hide=&#34;- Things people have said about me but collapsed&#34;]]
&gt; [[*user MoreMuffins]] said &#34;I have no idea who you are. +1&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user Ralliston]] said &#34;I remember the sonic-villain-whatever-his-name-was profile picture you. You cannot escape from me.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user NebulousStar]] said &#34;Ravioli, ravioli, give me all your money-oli.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user gee0765]] said &#34;Ravioli can&#39;t be metal that&#39;s literally impossible.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user Aftokrator]] said &#34;According to all known laws of Italian cuisine, there is no way ravioli can be made with metal.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user CaliBold]] said &#34;Of course, ravioli is made of metal anyway, because Italians don&#39;t care what humans think.&#34;
[[/collapsible]]

Hello! Welcome to my author page. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself! My name is MetalRavioli, my pronouns are She/Her, and I very much enjoy being here on the SCP wiki.

My main interests in life include fishkeeping, writing, and sleeping. I spend a lot of time attempting to write, however, a lot of it is pretty shit. My works on the site are just a few of many ideas I&#39;ve had and have sprawled out in my sandbox, but for the most part don&#39;t end up posting, since they&#39;re usually shit.

Some of my scips take place at this site I created called Site-225.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]I know there&#39;s probably like a bazillion Site-225&#39;s on the wiki, but I like the number![[/span]] Site-225 is a site in Nevada, that specializes in the containment of animals and creatures of all sorts.

While I haven&#39;t been on the wiki for long, I can tell that there are a lot of great people here. I&#39;m very excited to get to know a lot of you and make some friends along the way! I&#39;ve known about the Foundation for a while, but I only began writing scips around March of 2021, which has turned into a never-ending loophole.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]God please help me[[/span]] Anyways, you&#39;re probably just here to read my stuff, so I&#39;ll shut up.

[[include component:image-block name=Vulture|caption=Here&#39;s Shadow!]]
[[[SCP-6773]]] - &#34;Shadow the Shy Bird&#34;

**Beginning Summary:** Gary, the owner of an animal sanctuary comes across this large injured bird, and takes it in. However, little does he know that taking in this bird will cause some wacky things to happen at his sanctuary!

**Authors Take:** This was the first SCP I ever wrote on the site, and it surprisingly survived! It took me ages to get it out, but around the beginning of July, I finally finished it and boldly posted it. As far as I know, it&#39;s a pretty decent scip!

[[include component:image-block name=Shoebill|caption=Axel!]]
[[[SCP-6366]]] - &#34;Bird of a Feather and its Icht Together&#34;

**Beginning Summary:** Axel, a shoebill, and Arsenio, a senegal bichir, are two sapient, thaumaturgically tied friends, who sometimes don&#39;t get along. Contained by the Foundation, the two are caught in the middle of a containment breach, and wacky hijinks ensue!

**Authors Take:** Probably my favorite piece I&#39;ve posted to the site. Took me a few weeks to write, and thanks to some very active critters I got it out fairly quickly! My first approach at comedy on the site turned out pretty well. [[*user Doctor Fullham]] also came up with the name for this one, so special thanks to them!

[[include component:image-block name=Crab|caption=Agent Lou, CWPA]]
[[[SCP-6922]]] - &#34;Agent Lou of the CWPA&#34;

**Beginning Summary:** Agents of the Foundation are cleaning up an oil spill when suddenly the oil starts demanifesting. Panicked, Dr. Anole begins searching for a possible anomaly and comes across an overly sarcastic crab, who causes a bit of confusion.

**Authors Take:** I wrote this one in a few days, and I&#39;m fairly proud of it. Again, this is mostly due to some very helpful critters, who always lead me in the right direction. This is also the first article on the wiki that features the CWPA.

**Fun fact:** I actually named the crab in this after my betta fish who passed a few days prior.

[[[SCP-6447]]] - &#34;Sinners&#39; Symphony&#34;

**Beginning Summary:** The Foundation contains an amalgam made up of all the staff of Ex-Provisional Site-127, which is constantly singing. This entity exists to appease an Emergent Eschatological Entity (or EEE), being awakened, which could possibly threaten the entirety of humanity.

**Author&#39;s Take:** This was a mega-collab done with [[*user Jack Waltz]], [[*user Elunerazim]], [[*user MoreMuffins]], [[*user Aftokrator]], [[*user LORDXVNV]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user GreenGolem]], [[*user JakdragonX]], and [[*user Cole 13]]! It was super chaotic and fun to write, which we did sentence by sentence. It was crazy, but we all had a lot of fun!

[[include component:image-block name=Cow|caption=😍😍🥺🥰😳😳😳😍🥺]]
[[[SCP-6179]]] - &#34;Cow Love&#34;

**Beginning Summary:** The Foundation contains two sentient cows, both of which are very upset. However, Foundation therapist Dr. Anish soon learns that these two cows have some romantic tension.

**Author&#39;s Take:** First coldpost to the site![[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Besides the 2021 Art Exchange but shut the fuck up that doesn&#39;t count[[/span]] It is still up, so I consider this a success. I personally really like this one. At the time of making, it was the longest piece I&#39;ve ever made, at 9.9K words. I wrote this one for my betrothed, who&#39;s favorite animal is the Highland Cow!

[[[The Critters of Kiryu Labs]]]

**Beginning Summary:** Dr. Mark Kiryu and Researcher Riven Mercer have an argument over the amount of pets in Kiryu Labs, and debate over whether or not Mark should get more. They are interrupted by Agent Tai Yang Shen, who informs them that a new anomaly has arrived, and wacky hijinks ensue!

**Authors Take:** I wrote this for [[*user Zyn]] in the 2021 Art Exchange, and it was a blast to write! I loved writing about the characters of Kiryu Labs, and I loved the character interactions I made happen in this tale!

[[&lt;]]
&gt; **Name:** Azariah Ravioli
&gt; 
&gt; **Position:** Doctor, Zoologist, Cryptobiologist
&gt; 
&gt; **Pronouns:** She/Her
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Clearance:** Level 3
&gt; 
&gt; **DOB:** 03/27/1922
&gt; 
&gt; **Location:** Site-225, Site-72
&gt; 
&gt; **History:** Born in Nevada in 1922, young Azariah Ravioli was born to Jessica Ravioli, and Benjamin Ravioli, both of who had jobs at the Foundation. Azariah had a rather happy childhood, she made friends among her peers, and got good grades. At the age of 18, Azariah graduated from high school and planned to become a surgeon. However, her plans were changed when her parents introduced her to the Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; Azariah instead went on to earn her Masters&#39;s Degree in zoology and cryptobiology. In 1948, At the age of 26, Azariah joined the Foundation and was stationed at Site-225. However, soon after she joined, a mass containment breach occurred in Site-225, which resulted in the death of her mother and father. Azariah mourned the death of her parents and vowed to support the Foundation they died for.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1949, Azariah was subject to an anomalous gas that mysteriously manifested in Site-225. This gas caused Azariah to gain a few animal-like characteristics, such as developing the gills and tail of an axolotl, as well as the ability to breathe underwater. Testing also revealed that Azariah had become anomalously resilient to higher levels of pressure. While this was initially shocking to Azariah, she quickly accepted her new characteristics.

SCP-4106 is the designation for the animated corpse of 63-year-old Judie Porter, measuring 162 centimeters in height and weighing 71 kilograms. The humanoid is believed to be both sentient and sapient, retaining a considerable amount of intelligence, despite its inability to converse properly. It is also reported that SCP-4106’s physical and mental condition is gradually returning to its state prior to its expiration. Areas in which decomposition is apparent are slowly mitigating, and SCP-4106’s understanding of concepts, both basic and complex, is steadily increasing.

It is expected for SCP-4106 to be fully rehabilitated (and lose its anomalous properties) on the 25th December 2023.

PoI-4106 is SCP-4106’s son, Dan Porter. PoI-4106 was responsible in the revival of SCP-4106 through a ritual using a book titled &#34;Reviving the Dead 101&#34;,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Despite claiming to have no prior knowledge on thaumaturgy.[[/span]] which he received from an unknown individual. Investigation into finding and detaining said person has failed due to the lack of information provided by PoI-4106.

@@ @@
SCP-4106 was discovered when PoI-4106’s neighbors reported a &#34;foul smell&#34; originating from his residence, and that he had failed to respond to them when prompted regarding the stench. Embedded agents in the local police department were subsequently sent in to investigate, discovering PoI-4106 and SCP-4106. Porter was detained and later interrogated while SCP-4106 was taken into Foundation custody following amnesticization of involved witnesses and parties.

A considerable level of thaumaturgy was also detected within the property&#39;s study, where the publication mentioned above was found and shortly confiscated.

**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Sasha Priscilla
**Interviewee:** PoI-4106

**Foreword:** The purpose of this interview is to discuss regarding SCP-4106 and the associated book.

= [[size 150%]]&lt;&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;&gt;[[/size]]

//[Priscilla enters the interview room, which consists of a table and two chairs, with a one-way window present on one side. Ve sets down ver clipboard and composes verself. PoI-4106 is seated with his legs crossed.]//

**Priscilla:** Good afternoon, Mr. Porter. We thank you again for cooperating with us in this interview. We&#39;ll only be asking you a handful of questions before you can go. Is there anything you have to say before we start?

**PoI-4106:** Not much, really.

**Priscilla:** Alright, let us begin, then.

//[Priscilla presents PoI-4106 with an image of the book.]//

**Priscilla:** Just for confirmation, is this the book you used to bring back your mother from the dead?

**PoI-4106:** That&#39;s rude, ain&#39;t it?

**Priscilla:** …I&#39;m sorry?

**PoI-4106:** You better be. That&#39;s no way to talk about my mother. She&#39;s not some walking corpse.

**Priscilla:** I&#39;m not sure I understand. That&#39;s exactly what she is?

//[PoI-4106 lets out a drawn-out sigh.]//

**PoI-4106:** Look, she may be in her sixties, but she still has a lot of youth in her.

**Priscilla:** That&#39;s not what I meant...Didn&#39;t you bring her back to life?

**PoI-4106:** Yeah, but still. It&#39;s kinda disrespectful, don&#39;t you think? I mean, this is my mother you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m quite offended by this. How would you feel if I thought your father was also dead when he was just old?

**Priscilla:** This is a serious question, Mr. Porter.

**PoI-4106:** I know, I know. I apologize. It&#39;s just... I tend to be the clown in the crowd, you know? Always making jokes and all that. //(Sighs)// Times were great back then.

//[Pause.]//

**Priscilla:** Could you please answer the question?

**PoI-4106:** Oh, yeah. The book, right?

//[PoI-4106 leans back in his chair.]//

**PoI-4106:** Yup, it&#39;s true. That&#39;s how I managed to get her back.

**Priscilla:** Where exactly did you obtain this book?

**PoI-4106:** The dark web, actually.

//[Priscilla raises an eyebrow.]//

**PoI-4106:** Alright, alright, it was the streets. Some stranger gave it to me on my way back from the cemetery. I was visiting my mother as usual. If I recall correctly, they came out from an alleyway like some murderer from a horror film, and offered me a way to bring my mum back to life, which was the book, obviously.

**Priscilla:** And you just accepted the offer?

**PoI-4106:** I missed her a lot, cut me some slack. Besides, it was free.

**Priscilla:** Right. //(Sighs)// Have you had any prior experience with thaumaturgy?

**PoI-4106:** Thauma- what now?

**Priscilla:** Magic. As in, //actual// magic.

**PoI-4106:** Well, I was a magician back in the day, doing shows in front of...children and older folks. But &#34;actual magic&#34;? Nah, I&#39;m an amateur at best.

**Priscilla:** Really? You were able to revive her back from the dead, mind you. And with our research, she&#39;s been improving both physically and mentally, though it&#39;s very gradual.

**PoI-4106:** Yeah, but the book said it would take an instant. I&#39;m just glad it worked.

**Priscilla:** I see. Do you have any other intentions with the book? How about your father? Were you planning to bring him back as well? Assuming he is also deceased.

**PoI-4106:** I never knew my father. He left my mum before I was born.

**Priscilla:** Oh, apologies then.

**PoI-4106:** //(Sighs)// Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m over it.

//[PoI-4106 proceeds to stretch.]//

**Priscilla:** Right. //(Clears throat)// Getting back on topic, what else were you going to do with the book?

**PoI-4106:** I&#39;m not sure. Probably sell it, who knows. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/witch-and-lich-prologue aspiring wizard] or anything. I just wanna bring my mum back.

**Priscilla:** Would you mind telling me why?

**PoI-4106:** &#39;Cause I love her. What else? She wanted to be a writer, but then her heart decided to give in before she even finished her first novel. It was devastating, especially with the times she let me look over her progress. The words she used, the way she described the characters and their surroundings, it all felt real, you know. That&#39;s not something that should easily be thrown away.

**Priscilla:** Is that so?

**PoI-4106:** Yeah, and she was determined to make it to the top, to be known worldwide. Very inspiring, really. //(Chuckles)// I also brought her back &#39;cause I wanted to have some tea with her again. She makes the best earl grey.

//[PoI-4106 stares at the ceiling fan.]//

**PoI-4106:** So it would be nice if you helped me.

**Priscilla:** Pardon?

**PoI-4106:** I&#39;m not asking much. I just want your help getting her back to top-notch condition. Maybe even let me have a cup of tea with her every once in a while? I promise not to tell nobody.

**Priscilla:** And how can we trust you?

**PoI-4106:** Because I&#39;d be dead otherwise with all you could do to me. I&#39;m not looking for power or wealth or any of that bullshit. I just wanna spend some time with my mum like I used to, that&#39;s all. Could you at least give me that?

//[Pause. Priscilla sighs.]//

**Priscilla:** Fine, I&#39;ll file a request for the higher-ups. But we have our eye on you.

**PoI-4106:** I know that, but thank you, miss. I appreciate it. //(Scoffs)// Maybe we can let you join in on our teatimes as well.

**Priscilla:** Um, I prefer coffee.

**Afterword:** PoI-4106 has been permitted weekly visits to SCP-4106’s cell under the agreement that he would keep the Veil of normalcy.

It’s been hard on you, hasn’t it?

You can admit it, it’s alright. It’s been rough on everybody. I figured this whole thing might present different challenges for you than for- other people.

So why didn’t you call Dr. Chappel?

Are you alright?

You know, you can tell me if something’s wrong. Lots of us are having a really hard time, you don’t have to try and-

...oh. That’s… I think that’s normal, considering everything.  Can you describe it a little?

Alright. When you start feeling like that, I want you to write it down for me, if you can. If it’s still happening next week, we can look at it a little closer.

Yeah, you’ve said that. But I’ve noticed you’ve been quieter than usual. 

Of course. You’re not the only one who’s felt different. Weird mental health hiccups all over the site. It’s my job, I’ve been watching everyone. 

You and I both then, I guess.

Additional testing to SCP-6320. Begin log.

Test subject: D-8379834. Supervising researcher: Dr. Masterson, Head of Research. 

D-class instructed to approach [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-6320 SCP-6320] Dash B, the smaller replication created by the previous test. Subject expressed significant reluctance to comply. Subject eventually complied under threat of decreased rations by Dr. Masterson. 

Director Klein expressed in an earlier statement that D-Class testing will largely decrease under the present circumstances. “We no longer have a virtually unlimited supply of them,” Klein says, “If touching it still does the same thing it did on the outside, we’ll need to have as few people touching it as we can. In case we need them later.” 

Dr. Alves, Head of Containment, made a statement following this. Said Dr. Alves, “Dr. Klein has always shown reluctance toward D-Class testing. We must use all the tools we have at our disposal in this emergency. We should not be trapped here for long enough to have a ‘later.’” 

Dr. Alves has shown some degree of animosity toward Dr. Klein in the wake of Upper Management’s decision to appoint the latter as Acting Director. 

D-Class testing continues as follows:

D-class approached SCP-6320-B. Dr. Masterson instructed him to place his hand on the object. After some complaints, subject placed his hand on the object. All previous testing involving direct contact with SCP-6320 yielded the same results; the complete disappearance of the test subject. However, upon making contact with SCP-6320-B, subject-

Overwatch Command, this is Dr. Harley at Site-107. Come in, Overwatch Command. Over.

You know what’s strange about working here?

Or living here, as is the present case…

I had a couple friends I used to drink with on the outside. They weren’t “friends,” really, they were more like “drinking buddies.” These two that were regulars at the bar under my apartment building. Sometimes I’d drink with them after work.

One of them thought their house was haunted. She talked about it all the time. She said she felt like she was being watched.

And you know what I realized? 

I literally am being watched. All the time. I’m not high up at all, I’m not an important researcher or anything, but the radio booth still has a camera in it. The Foundation has cameras everywhere. 

And it’s weird for the first couple years after you really get into it. I don’t think there are cameras in our dormitories, but honestly? I wouldn’t put it past the people that run this place. I’ve heard about some of the ways they locate prospective anomalies and can’t help but think about where they must have stuck a camera in order to see it. 

Eventually you get used to it. There’s probably some poor bastard at Site-19 who has seen me wipe my ass. Who knows? And who cares? I’m never gonna meet them, it doesn’t matter one way or the other.

The real watchers aren’t ghosts. Or “the government.” It’s the Foundation. We’re the real Big Brother, if you think about it.

Part One. Food, obviously. Paper and pens. Any and all medication. We’ve run dreadfully short on common cold medicine after the Security Department all contracted the same minor bug, because it turns out that for the past several days they’ve all been sharing the site’s only known 2-liter bottle of Dr. Pepper. Passing it among themselves in secret like prohibition liquor. 

Also prescription drugs. We’ve had to start rationing everything out among individuals. This has been especially difficult for the people still recovering from injuries sustained in the initial shift, when most of the BC2 wing collapsed. Not a lot of morphine around anymore. 

Let’s see, what else? Oh yeah, SOAP. Shampoo, laundry detergent, disinfectant, glass cleaner, deodorant, toilet paper… 

...condoms…

Lots of things. Ran out of alcohol a LONG time ago. We’re going to have to get real creative in the next couple weeks. We’ve been in here nearly a month, now.

Dr. Lancaster has taken to passing his guitar around during lunch. Don’t know how much it’s helping, but some people seem to enjoy it. Psychology’s last report indicates a pretty substantial spike in suicide ideation among personnel-

Upon physical contact with SCP-6320-B, D-class did not vanish as was expected by the Research Department. Instead, when he put his hand on the small replication, D-class reported a sharp pain and a tingling sensation and pulled his hand back. 

Dr. Masterson instructed the subject to keep his hand on the object. Subject refused, saying something about how the object had “shocked” him. Dr. Masterson allowed D-class to report to Medical alongside 2 guards. Head of Medical, Dr. Gravett, found no evidence of injury on the subject, save for a darkened mark on the palm of his hand, seemingly under the skin, no scar tissue to speak of. The mark was amorphous with no recognizable shape.

-Botany has a substantial lead on a renewable food source, albeit a small one. With Upper Management’s permission, they’ve collected anything that has the capacity to grow from scraps; potatoes, romaine heads, anything organic where the seeds aren’t compromised. It’ll be some time before any of that is able to feed a hundred people, but it’s better than nothing. Somehow we’re missing a good deal of the dry grains from storage. Nobody knows where it’s gone. Maintenance is looking into pest control. 

If it really comes down to it, having mice or rats around might not be the worst thing, should we run out of food completely.

I’m slowly becoming an old-timey switchboard operator, aren’t I?

God, I miss Wi-fi.

Engineering is actually working on jerry-rigging our site intranet back up. It certainly would make things a thousand times easier for Research and Records with the testing and everything. 

We might even get access to an old backup of the Foundation Database. Research and Containment are keen on that idea, because there’s a strong possibility that what we’ve learned from other dimensional anomalies might give us some insight on how to deal with this one. Dr. Shao from the Ethics Committee has Level 4 clearance, so they might be able to get us into some of the more secured information. 

Hell, if we do get access, I might even read it. I’m Level 2, so I wouldn’t have access to most of the entries, but I’m starting to get a little bored and I’m sure it’s better than nothing. I’ve already read most of my own books a couple times. 

There’s talk about pooling entertainment sources. It’s mostly Lancaster’s idea, of course. He wants to get a library set up so we can share books and things like DVDs and records. Right now it looks like 90% of the TV content we have is Klein’s extensive anime collection. Not really my taste, but better than nothing, I suppose. I’m accepting that I’ll soon have encyclopedic knowledge of several pieces of media, including Dragonball Z.

Incident report.

Dr. Harley attempts to reach Acting Site Director Dr. Klein multiple times. Dr. Klein’s walkie is unresponsive, later shown to have run out of battery power. Dr. Harley is heard in one-sided communication with the site surveillance office in an attempt to locate Dr. Klein. Eventually, Dr. Harley contacts Dr. Masterson, who alerts Dr. Klein of the situation. 

Via the Research Department intercom, Dr. Harley informs Dr. Klein of the possible formation of an instance of SCP-6320 Dash 1 occurring within a water damage stain located approximately 2 meters from Door BH-9-7, the entrance to the main containment chamber of SCP-6320. Dr. Klein confirms the formation to be an instance of SCP-6320 Dash 1 before exiting the hallway.

It is of note that the instance in question began formation approximately twelve meters outside the object’s previously established area of effect.

Dr. Beatrix Klein, Acting Site Director, Clearance Level 6320 Dash 4. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

That is correct.

Dr. Harley from Communications called me and told me there was a possible Dash 1 forming in the hall outside the containment chamber.

-with a flare gun, yes. 

I don’t really know, it was sorta the first thing that came to mind? I didn’t think my regular gun would quite do it.

I admit, it was rash. But it worked, didn’t it?

Yeah, yeah, “secure, contain, protect, not destroy destroy destroy,” sure, all that shit, but-

But I wasn’t destroying the scip. I was destroying an effect of the scip. We do that all the time. We incinerate all kinds of Dash 1’s.

No, I don’t think that. Last time we let a Dash 1 complete itself, it shook the entire building.

Sure, but I’d rather not risk it if it is the case. I’m gonna keep my people safe, that’s my first priority.

Overwatch Command, we learn something new every day. About ourselves, about the inner workings of our organization, about the dimensional rift under our feet.

For example, today we learned that 6320 isn’t planning on staying where it’s supposed to.

The Dash 1 beside Door BH-9-7 was halted. But it also occurred roughly 25 meters outside the radius it isn’t supposed to leave. We don’t know if this means it could happen anywhere, but at Klein’s direction we are now acting on the assumption that it could happen anywhere. 

As I’m broadcasting this, the Research Department is currently conducting two more particulate tests inside the containment chamber. Thirty grams of loose sand in two separate arrangements. Three meters from the rift. A couple seconds apart. Dr. Klein has sent out a warning to the site in case we experience another minor tremor, which is expected at this point.

I am holding my coffee mug. I will not lose another one. 

Containment is going to have to revise their methods rather severely after this. I have a nagging worry that things are about to get way more stringent around here, especially knowing Dr. Alves. Bit of a hardass, that one. Good at her job, though.

Following this broadcast, I will be meeting with both her and Dr. Kl-

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//Amy Grace is in her office, absentmindedly reading documents sent in for approval. She hears someone knock on her door.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** Is that you, Jeremy? Come on in.
[[=]]
//Jeremy Filia pokes his head in, and enters the room. He sits in one of the cushioned chairs, across from Amy Grace.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** Good afternoon, how are you doing? How&#39;s the family?

**Jeremy Filia:** Good! Good. We went on that road trip I was talking about. You know the one.

**Amy Grace:** That&#39;s great! What&#39;d you do?

**Jeremy Filia:** Oh, lot&#39;s of things. Everything around the block. Natural history museum, a couple national parks, Hoover Dam. It was good.

**Amy Grace:** Hoover? That&#39;s pretty far. Stop by Vegas?

**Jeremy Filia:** Nah, I wouldn&#39;t risk it. I know we have the Indulgences Policy, but why take the chance, right? Since Hell is real, apparently.

**Amy Grace:** Yeah, that&#39;s fair. I&#39;ve heard... that it requires belief in Christianity. Not too sure.

**Jeremy Filia:** Still wouldn&#39;t risk it. Oh, and also, still pissed off the wife. I couldn&#39;t explain why we couldn&#39;t go to Vegas, which is why I wanted to talk to you about that family referral plan. Get her into the workforce, spill the beans about the anomalous. Is it still in the works?

**Amy Grace:** You know how it is. Ethics is still not over the whole &#34;testing anomalies on family members&#34; incident at -55. The plan probably fell through.

**Jeremy Filia:** Damn.

**Amy Grace:** Yeah.
[[=]]
//Silence.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** Oh, right. We&#39;re still on the clock, Jeremy.

**Jeremy Filia:** I skimmed the email. What am I doing?

**Amy Grace:** Just a quick employee evaluation. There&#39;s some paperwork involved, but it&#39;s basically just busywork from HR. Boring stuff.

**Jeremy Filia:** Ah, right.

**Amy Grace:** So here&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen. I ask you some questions, you answer them, and we can go on our merry way.

**Jeremy Filia:** Sweet.

**Amy Grace:** Okay, first question. //&#39;From 1 to 5, 5 being the best, how safe do you feel at work?&#39;//

**Jeremy Filia:** 4.

**Amy Grace:** //Is your worklife balance satisfactory?//

**Jeremy Filia:** 4.
[[=]]
//This repeats seven more times, before moving on.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** Alrighty, this portion is a bit more complex. Feel free to elaborate as you see fit. //&#39;Do you believe the duties assigned to you are inappropriate for your position? If so, explain what and why.&#39;//

**Jeremy Filia:** Not at all. In fact, I like to think that I&#39;m exceeding in some ways.
[[=]]
//They politely laugh.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** That&#39;s good. Oh, I missed a question. Bear with me. //&#39;How have you improved since you started this job? What did you do that was not included in your job description but you believe is exemplary of your proactive... ness?&#39;//

**Jeremy Filia:** They should really get someone to proofread this thing.

**Amy Grace:** Yeah, it&#39;s really weird.

**Jeremy Filia:** Well, to answer the question, I actually did do something new. I noticed that the janitor&#39;s closet was left unlocked, so I just grabbed a couple chemicals and used it.

**Amy Grace:** A couple chemicals?

**Jeremy Filia:** Yeah, bleach and a couple others.

**Amy Grace:** Wait, why? To clean the breakroom?

**Jeremy Filia:** Nah, to pour it on some poor fellow.
[[=]]
//Silence.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** What are you talking about?

**Jeremy Filia:** You know. To get him to talk.
[[=]]
//Silence.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** No, I don&#39;t know. I mean- you poured- what the fuck?

**Jeremy Filia:** What?

**Amy Grace:** You poured //bleach// on someone? Who- what in the world?!

**Jeremy Filia:** It&#39;s not //that// bad.

**Amy Grace:** What do you- oh my god, you poured //bleach// on someone!

**Jeremy Filia:** It&#39;s just some AWCY? narcissist. It&#39;s no George Bush, that&#39;s for sure.

**Amy Grace:** It doesn&#39;t matter //who// you hurt. Th- this violates the fucking //Geneva Conventions//. The UIU are gonna have a fucking //field day// with this one. What in the world were you //thinking//?!

**Jeremy Filia:** Why are you getting angry at me? I just did my job.

**Amy Grace:** Your JOB? Have you been pouring bleach on people //this whole time//?

**Jeremy Filia:** Well, no, just the one time.

**Amy Grace:** Oh my god. Have you been torturing people?

**Jeremy Filia:** And what the fuck do you mean that //isn&#39;t my job//?

**Amy Grace:** We- what-

**Jeremy Filia:** &#39;Persuasion&#39;? That&#39;s basically code speak for &#39;hit &#39;em where it hurts&#39;.

**Amy Grace:** No! That&#39;s not what it fucking means!

**Jeremy Filia:** That&#39;s exactly what it means. Okay, even if there was a mix-up, you can&#39;t pin this one on me. This isn&#39;t my fault.

**Amy Grace:** Ohhhhh my god.

**Jeremy Filia:** It&#39;s literally the &#39;Department of Atypical Persuasion&#39;. What is that supposed to mean? That&#39;s just legalese for torture.

**Amy Grace:** It&#39;s- it&#39;s a political department! You&#39;re supposed to //literally persuade people// into doing stuff, like giving up information. We&#39;re supposed to negotiate deals!

**Jeremy Filia:** And torture isn&#39;t a part of persuasion?

**Amy Grace:** It&#39;s not! That&#39;s just being evil! Oh my god, I&#39;m gonna have a heart attack.

//She opens up a cabinet and quickly retrieves a bottle of wine. She stabs the cork with a Swiss army knife and pours its contents into a plastic cup half filled with leftover coffee. She downs it, and spits out some cork material.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** What about- what about the rest?

**Jeremy Filia:** The rest? You mean the rest of the department?

**Amy Grace:** Oh my god.

**Jeremy Filia:** We all torture people.

**Amy Grace:** Oh my god.
[[=]]
//She pours out another cup of wine.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** I&#39;m resigning and leaving the country. The Nuremberg Trials are fucking nothing compared to the shitstorm that&#39;s coming. How the fuck did we... how the fuck did we get a //torture squad// on //payroll//?

**Jeremy Filia:** I&#39;m pretty sure the Foundation has done worse.
[[=]]
//She glares at Jeremy Filia. He shrugs.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** Okay. Okay, I&#39;ve got it. I&#39;ve got a plan.

**Jeremy Filia:** Okay?

**Amy Grace:** We... I don&#39;t know. Could we... I don&#39;t know, make it official? Is that even possible? Oh god.

**Jeremy Filia:** I mean... we could.
[[=]]
//Silence.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** No we aren&#39;t. The fuck we are. We&#39;re doomed.

**Jeremy Filia:** Like, look, here&#39;s my business card.

[[image card2.png style=&#34;border: solid 2px grey; box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;&#34;]]

**Amy Grace:** What the fuck. Did you- did you make this?

**Jeremy Filia:** Pretty much, yeah. I sent in a request and they just printed out a hundred for me. I&#39;ve been giving them out to people outside of Site-12, and they pretty much take it in stride. The rest of the department already thinks it&#39;s legitimate. Might as well formalize it.
[[=]]
//Silence.//
[[/=]]
**Amy Grace:** This is insane.

**Jeremy Filia:** That&#39;s a you problem. We&#39;re all good.

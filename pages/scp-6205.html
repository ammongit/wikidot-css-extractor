**Special Containment Procedures:** Online Web-Crawlers are to search and take down any remixes or copies of SCP-6205-A and SCP-6205-B. (Currently, 85% of SCP-6205-A and B instances have been taken down online.) All physical copies, tracks, records, etc. are to be located and stored in a Site-35 anomalous locker by MTF ETA-11.
Â 
**Description:** SCP-6205-A, also known as &#39;&#39;From The Dark&#39;&#39; is a music piece made by SCP-6205-2 (Francis Diego.) SCP-6205-A: When listened to for over 20 seconds will infect the subject listening to it. (Now referred to as SCP-6205-1.) The anomalous effects of SCP-6205-A start when every song heard by SCP-6205-1 sounds like SCP-6205-A. All memory of music and music itself in the brain of SCP-6205-1 will be replaced with SCP-6205-A. Everything SCP-6205-1 will learn about music will be forgotten with 10 seconds. SCP-6205-B has no cure, but effects aren&#39;t that damaging so this does not matter, SCP-6205-A&#39;s anomalous effects can be removed using Class-B Amnestics. SCP-6205-A has been taken down by the foundation and replaced with a new &#39;&#39;From The Dark&#39;&#39; song with no anomalous effects.

SCP-6205-B, &#39;&#39;From The Light&#39;&#39; is also a song by SCP-6205-2. When listened to, its anomalous effects will start the next day. When you wake up, you will remember nothing about the day before apart from listening to SCP-6205-B. Research proves that everything except listening to SCP-6205-B from the previous day has been completely removed from the mind after going to sleep. SCP-6205-B has also taken down by the foundation and replaced with a new, Non-anomalous &#39;&#39;From The Light&#39;&#39; song. 

Agent Fallgon found out that Francis Diego, (SCP-6205-2) had a lawyer, so he went undercover, making the lawyer believe he was trying to hire Francis, but the lawyer told him that Francis had disappeared three months earlier, last seen on the exact day before the note was sent to Site-35. A manhunt was then set up for SCP-6205-2.

**Incident Log:**


Agent Fallgon found out that Francis Diego, (SCP-6205-2) had a lawyer, so he went undercover, making the lawyer believe he was trying to hire Francis, but the lawyer told him that Francis had disappeared three months earlier, last seen on the exact day before the note was sent to Site-35. A manhunt was then set up for SCP-6205-2. Later, she was found in Wales and imprisoned there temporarily until MTF ETA-11 arrived at the prison to transport Francis Diego to Site-35. But when they arrived the prison had completely lost power and the only surviving people in the prison was Francis Diego. She seemed to have escaped, but was caught by ETA-11.

&gt; Francis Diego retrieval log.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 1: Control, we have arrived at the prison, but it looks powered down.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Operative: Yeah, it looks abandoned.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: We&#39;re heading in.
&gt; 
&gt; //ETA-11 Unit entered the prison and split up.//
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: Group 2, status report?
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 2: Everyone&#39;s dead, commander.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Operative: Including the prisoners, but we found no trace of Francis.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 2: Yeah, place is deserted.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Operative: I&#39;m calling in a search party.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 1: Yeah, you do that.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: Transceivers are jammed.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 1: Damn it.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: There&#39;s nothing left here for us.
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative 1: Alright, lets move out.
&gt; 
&gt; //ETA-11 left the prison and found Francis Diego trying to escape.//
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: STOP RIGHT THERE FRANCIS!
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Senior Operative: HANDS IN THE AIR NOW! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!
&gt; 
&gt; Francis Diego: The Foundation..
&gt; 
&gt; ETA-11 Commander: Damn right, now put your hands behind your back or we will shoot!
&gt; 
&gt; //Francis Diego was transported to Site-35.//

SCP-6205-2 Interview attempt log.

&gt; SCP-6205-2: Hello, Agent.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Fallgon: Why did you create anomalous music that is dangerous?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: It is not dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Fallgon: You keep up that attitude and you&#39;re never getting out of here, SCP-6205-2.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: Please stop calling me that.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Fallgon: No.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Fallgon: It does not matter. I will ask you again. Why did you create anomalous music?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: I don&#39;t understand why all of this is necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Fallgon: I&#39;m leaving for now, and you damn well better respond when I come back later.

//2 hours and 43 minutes later, Chaos Insurgency raided Site-35. They went to SCP-6205-2&#39;s cell and questioned her, and after a few minutes they shot Francis Diego until she was dead. Audio logs were later recovered.//

Recovered Audio Logs

&gt; SCP-6205-2: You don&#39;t look like the foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; Chaos Insurgency Soldier: We aren&#39;t, but we are here for one purpose. What are the effects of your anomaly, and how can we weaponize it?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: It isn&#39;t dangerous. People just sometimes get strange side effects after listening to my music.
&gt; 
&gt; Chaos Insurgency Soldier: Well, what are those side effects?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: Mostly blurry memory and forgetting about the concept of music itself, nothing serious. I&#39;d say its very forgetful music.
&gt; 
&gt; Chaos Insurgency Soldier: This was a waste of time.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6205-2: What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; Chaos Insurgency Soldier: Kill her.
&gt; 
&gt; //It is confirmed that SCP-6205-2 was terminated by the Chaos Insurgency.//</textarea></pre>

**Item #:** SCP-6417

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures** Entity is to be kept in a standard 8x8 humanoid containment cell, which is to be located on the sub-tropical island of [REDACTED]

. The outer layer of the cell is to have no entry point and is to be reinforced with a 1-meter thick layer of a titanium alloy, and completely soundproofed. Ground underneath the entity&#39;s containment cell is to be replaced with a 1-meter concrete slab. The entity&#39;s cell is to be placed within a large room with a mesh roof and dirt floor, which is to be full of vegetation and the following:
* One (1) caged leopard
* Two (2) toucans
* One(1) 3x3 meter pool of water
* Six (6) barracuda, within the pool of water

Internal walls of the containment cell art to be fitted with thermal sensors, approxamately 2.5 meters above the floor, well out of the entity&#39;s reach. Two (2) guards are to be posted on each wall of the external rool. Guards are only to speak through their internal communication systems, and any guards who alert the entity to any human presence are subject to disiplinary action, as the entity is to be under the illusion that it is alone in a tropical forest. In the event that the entity would breach containment, procedure Lima-Oscar 9 is to be initiated, and full site lockdown is to be put under effect.

**Description:** SCP-6417 is an entirely invisible humanoid figure, approxamately 1.14 meters in height, the average size of a six (6) year old female child.The entity is only able to be tracked by means of thermal energy and sound, and is constantly monitored by thermal sensors placed throughout Site [REDACTED] The entity is deemed sentient, and has shown a multitude of personality traits, such as mild claustrophobia. For this reason, all hallways in Site [REDACTED] have been made incredibly thin. The entity is not to be exposed to any humans, and any testing on it is to be done entirely remotely. 

The entity shows varying levels of “existence”, depending on the exposed subject. The entity, to a normal human, shows low levels of existence, for example: A man who is exposed to SCP-6365, and has not “latched” onto him, shows its presence through only its thermal signature and its ability to hear and speak (if it chooses to). If the entity latches onto a subject, the subject’s mental health will begin to steadily deteriorate, until the subject has lost all sense of self. The subjects experience once being latched on to varies but most (roughly 88%) experience the following:
   
1-5 hours since exposure-
   Subject begins to see and hear the entity. Entity is speaking, but speech seems to be entirely impossible                  to understand. Speech is not backward, but it seems to be in the entity’s own language. 
6-8 hours since exposure-
   Subject will begin to hear the entity giving them instructions to build a structure (see Addendum 1). Subject will feel mildly compelled to obey, and will begin to absentmindedly mumble instructions back to themself.
9-12 hours after exposure-
   Subject will no longer want to participate in any other activities, and will begin to carry out building instructions, taking breaks only to eat, sleep, and drink.
12-48 hours after exposure-
   Subject will no longer feel the need to eat, drink, or sleep. Subject will continue to build until they either die of starvation, or agitate the entity.

The entity becomes agitated if the construction is not completed within 48 hours, and for this reason, the entity will attempt to make multiple subjects attempt to build at the same time. When agitated, the entity will emit a shriek at an immeasurably high frequency. This shriek will cause the subject to work incredibly fast, moving at a speed high enough that the tendons in the body will tear. When the subject has made himself unable to build any further due to torn tendons, the subject will begin to writhe on the floor, apparently being physically affected by the entity’s shrieking. The subject will begin to bleed through every orifice in the body, including the nose, eyes, ears, mouth, and [REDACTED].

**Addendum 1:** The structure that the entity instructs the subject to build has been described as a type of portal. Schematics appear to be beyond human knowledge. Investigation undergoing.

**Addendum 2:** Entity&#39;s subjects have successfully completed portal due to Site power outage. New anomaly discovered.</textarea></pre>

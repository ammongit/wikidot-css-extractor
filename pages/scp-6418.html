**Item #:** SCP-6418

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** Impossible to contain.

**Description:** SCP-6418 is the world that resides on the other end of the portal constructed by  [[[SCP-6417]]. The alternate world on the other end of the portal is the same as ours, but --without any organic life forms-- ravaged by a bacterial infection similar to [[[SCP-610]]]. The infection, when the portal was initally opened, began to spread into this world, and was suppressed. A containment cell that is being indefinitely decontaminated tha been built around the portal on both sides. Any personell using the portal are to wear full Hazmat gear. The infection has been called the &#34;Xiphos Bacterium&#34; by the former inhabitants of this world (There hae been pamphlets about the infection that were read by observing agents). The Bacterium&#39;s symtoms vary (see Incident Log 001-003) and the infected tend to show violent tendencies (Incident Log 004). Despite varying symtoms, the infected always seems to have five (5) stages. The infection can not spread in to this world, or a F-Class Extinction Scenario --may-- will occur. The bacteria has shown the ability to manifest in a technological viris as well as a biological virus. The Bacterium has shown a low level of sentience, and will disrupt any typed information that may lead to a cure or vaccine.</textarea></pre>

**Note:** If you&#39;re looking to get an idea or draft critiqued, feel free to contact me over wikidot PM and I&#39;ll do my best to get back to you. Please note that if your concept is outside of my usual area of specialty I likely will not be able to give you a proper crit!

[[span style=&#34;font-family: Baskerville Old Face;&#34;]] [[size 350%]]Fable[[/size]] [[/span]]

A fairly new face on staff that&#39;s managed to get their hands in a few projects. Since joining Foundation staff, Fable has been seen largely involving themself with items dealing with the paranormal, folklore, animals, and items with general low risk. Beyond that, they&#39;ve been active with helping other researchers develop their SCP and incident report articles. As a result they&#39;re easily found in site libraries, animal holding pens, and similar locations!

Seriously though, I typically specialize in SCPs that deal with ghosts, folktales, myths, or animals. A list of my SCP works is set up below, and hopefully one day Wikidot will be a functional site and actually show it.

I write tales sometimes. They&#39;re fun.

[[span style=&#34;font-family: Baskerville Old Face;&#34;]] [[size 350%]]Personal Thoughts:[[/size]] [[/span]]

* [[[SCP-5372]]] &#34;My Gift to You, Oh Love&#34;: A simple story about a gay couple in the 50&#39;s and the cave that hid their love from the world. It&#39;s a short read, but one of my personal favorite works of mine.

* [[[SCP-5828]]] &#34;As in Life, So in Death&#34;: My most popular work on the wiki so far, as well as my first! Tells the story of an angry ghost and explores how media/popular perception of people can twist a narrative. Deals with themes of emotional manipulation, so be warned in advance. 

* [[[SCP-5829]]] &#34;The Prophet Hen of Boring&#34;: I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, and I really wanted to write an article involving them. While not my strongest work on the site, I do think it&#39;s a nice, short story about a hen with a tough life.

* [[[SCP-5469]]] &#34;Winnie&#39;s Diner&#34;: I don&#39;t think I can say anything on this that wasn&#39;t already covered by my author&#39;s comment. My longest work yet and very character focused. This took a long time to write, and I think it is my best work here yet. 

* [[[SCP-6033]]] &#34;The Friend With Many Arms&#34;: A fun romp mixing some of my artwork with a wholesome story involving a boy and his monster. Currently my highest rated work, and I&#39;m beyond grateful for that.

* [[[SCP-6404]]] &#34;My Name is Your Name and Your Name is My Name&#34;: My first real &#34;horror&#34; article, and something WAY out of my normal style. I wasn&#39;t planning to hop on the shortform article trend, but I got hit with an idea that&#39;s perfect for it. If you like fridge horror, this one&#39;s for you.

* [[[SCP-6968]]] &#34;Fantastic Fearsome Critters&#34;: This is my love letter to good old American folklore. Have you heard of the Jackalope? The Fur Bearing Trout? Well this is me putting them in SCP form, with some deeper commentary on the treatment of animals when money is involved.

[[span style=&#34;font-family: Baskerville Old Face;&#34;]] [[size 350%]]My Recurring Characters:[[/size]] [[/span]]


**Dr. Faran Caraway:** A site director for a unimportant site dealing in unimportant anomalies. Dr. Caraway is regarded as a &#34;genuinely nice guy&#34;, even with the horns and tail. Still, a man who looks a bit more like a demon than a man is far from unusual in the Foundation&#39;s world. He has a love of plants and animals, and is most commonly seen leaving notes on SCP articles to remind researchers of potentially upsetting content. 

Dr. Caraway is currently seen in [[[SCP-6968]]], as well as [[[Dr. Caraway and Agent Sias Fight Over Pelican Meat]]].

**Agent Basil Sias:** A member of the newly formed Department of Interpersonal Affairs, Agent Basil Sias is the Foundation&#39;s go-to man for anomalies and situations that require sensitive communication. He&#39;s smart and charismatic, and is the kind of person who others open up to quickly. While the Foundation often uses this to their advantage, Agent Sias does seek to form as many legitimate relationships with the people he meets as possible. At the end of the day his goal is to ensure that people are happy and healthy, and he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to achieve that.

Agent Sias is currently seen assisting with [[[SCP-5828]]] and [[[SCP-6033]]]. He&#39;s also seen in [[[Dr. Caraway and Agent Sias Fight Over Pelican Meat]]]. Check them out if you want to see him in action!

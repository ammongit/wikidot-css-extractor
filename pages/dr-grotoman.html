Dr. Grotoman sat at his desk, writing about the biology of SCP-106, how it had gotten that sickening grey-green acidic ooze, playing with a rubber band to keep his mind off of the horror of it. He wasn&#39;t making much progress. He had always been fascinated by SCP-106, however terrified he was of it, however much he hated that they had to break a leg to get it back into containment. He kept a journal of all the things he could never say to his colleagues. He never liked how they treated the D-class there. They //were// death row inmates, but they were still //people//. He had even heard rumors of an anomaly which required the cannibalization of a baby. He never really liked the fact that all SCP&#39;s, including the actual people and the ones of human level-intelligence, were referred to as &#34;it&#34;, even 682, he was very angry, but he was still very intelligent, there must have been //some// reason he was so angry at the world. He didn&#39;t mind 106 being called it, however. That //thing// was not human even if it may have been, at one point. His colleagues always joked that he should go and join the Serpent&#39;s Hand. In all honesty, he did think they had somewhat of a point, not that he //would// ever defect. He liked his job, however weird and stressful and incredibly fucked up it could be. He supposed that it was perhaps better for the world that it didn&#39;t know about all of the crazy goings-on of the anomalous world. He was //willing// to die in the dark so others could live in the light, however much he hated the dark and however much he thought that the world perhaps deserved to know, at the very least that the world was not as simple as it seemed, and at the //very// least deserved to know that anomalies //existed//, although perhaps not of all the gross details. 

Dr. Grotoman couldn&#39;t detach himself from the world like most of his colleagues could, he wasn&#39;t cold and unfeeling like Dr. Gears, he wasn&#39;t such a loose cannon that nothing could bother him like the ever-elusive Dr. A-major chord on a ukulele otherwise known as Dr. Clef and he wasn&#39;t immortal like Dr. Bright or possibly the 05-council (what a very strange place this was). He knew that there had to be a better way of doing things. Dr. Grotoman had met Dr. Gears once. He didn&#39;t like the experience and vowed to never meet him again, he knew the others by reputation only. He was friends with Dr. Cimmerian though, one of the only other sane people at the foundation.

John Grotoman had always heard the terrible stories of The Global Occult Coalition and how they treated anomalies like trash and killed them without a second thought, but how was the foundation different by using D-class? The foundation wasn&#39;t quite as cruel to D-Class as the Coalition was to anomalies, they didn&#39;t kill them without a second thought. But the way they treated D-class was almost worse, they had no names, only being referred to by numbers, their identity taken away. And there had to be some people wrongfully accused in there. And they //were people//. Dr. Grotoman had a reputation for being a very quiet person  at the foundation. He wished he didn&#39;t, when he was younger he was the life of the party, the guy that everybody loved. He used to be happy. But now he had so much weighing on his conscience that he couldn&#39;t say anything anymore. John Grotoman was not the man Jane, his wife, fell in love with all those years ago. He could never talk about anything. But he couldn&#39;t quit, if he tried to quit, they&#39;d amnestisize him, and if he refused they&#39;d track him down. //No normal person could know about the anomalous world//, they&#39;d fill his head with the idea that he&#39;d been a regular doctor at a regular research facility researching regular biology. He&#39;d loose the last 10 years of his life. He hated the cold, sterile world of doctors researching increasingly horrifying anomalies with a straight face and sterile fact-based descriptions. He once thought he&#39;d get used to all this, but he didn&#39;t //want// to get used to it. He had to continue to realize how horrifying all of this bullshit was and how many horrifying sacrifices the foundation made in the name of &#34;protection.&#34; He&#39;d lost track of the amount of times he&#39;d been told that the SCP Foundation was &#34;cold, but not cruel&#34;. But they were cruel. They used actual people as disposable lab rats, and called them by a number. They killed and ate babies for crying out-loud--well //allegedly//. Maybe he should join the Serpent&#39;s Hand, show the foundation what for. He&#39;d been told that the Serpent&#39;s Hand was a terrorist group by everyone ever since he joined the foundation, a lie so placid and transparent he didn&#39;t understand how anyone could believe it. But he couldn&#39;t join the Serpent&#39;s Hand, he wanted out of the anomalous world all-together. Maybe that showed cowardice on his part, but maybe he was a coward. But he couldn&#39;t quit, he couldn&#39;t allow himself to forget all of this batshit insane fucked up bullshit, however hard the foundation would try to make him. 

So Dr. Grotoman sat at his desk, unsure what to do. Unsure wether to say &#34;fuck it&#34; and just leave and get tracked down and amnesticized or quit and get amnecticized, he was getting amnecticized either way. So he just sat at his desk, quiet, still. Eventually, Dr. Cimmerian came into his office. 
&#34;Hey, you feelin&#39; ok?&#34;
&#34;Yeah, just thinking&#34; Grotoman replied
&#34;Do you wanna talk about it?&#34;
&#34;Not really.&#34;
&#34;Ok...I&#39;ll leave you to your thinking.&#34;
So Dr. Cimmerian left, before he could go Dr. Grotoman blurted something out
&#34;Have you ever thought about quitting?&#34;
&#34;Have I ever thought about quitting?&#34;
&#34;Yeah, have you ever thought about quitting?&#34;
Dr. Cimmerian thought about it for a long time
&#34;Well...yes, I have thought about quitting, several times. But they&#39;d amnesticize you you know, you&#39;d have to go back to your regular life as if nothing had ever happened, and to you it never would have.&#34;
&#34;Yeah...I guess&#34;

So he sat at his desk for a long time more, until an idea hit him. What if he went to the site directors office and somehow switched out his amnestics for, like, water. But he didn&#39;t know if that would work, or even if there were amnestics in the site director&#39;s office. He did have a water bottle in his office, he&#39;d just need to get that into a bottle of amnestics and then palm the amnestics bottle and put it somewhere in the room without the man noticing and then get him to use that one. Simple enough. So he went into the site director&#39;s office, making sure to bring his water bottle. Thomas Graham had been out on temporary leave and replaced with 
++ Dr. Ruslav Diaghilev
Temporary

He gave the door a knock. 

&#34;Come in--&#34;

Dr. Grotoman Opened the door. The room was nicely decorated. There was a bottle of vodka in the back on a small table with drawers at the bottom and a painting in a rather ornate frame. The painting depicted a field of wheat with two of those big haybales.

Dr. Diaghilev sat at his desk very still, reading one of the SCP files, he couldn&#39;t make out which one. He was a very intimidating man, big glasses, dark hair, bulky build. 

&#34;Hey, uh...quick question, um...so...do you know where we keep the um...amnestics?&#34;
&#34;That is above your clearance level&#34; Dr. Diaghilev said very curtly.
&#34;Right yeah, no...that makes sense,&#34; he said turning around, &#34;I&#39;ll go uh find them myself.&#34;
&#34;You will do no such thing!&#34; Dr. Diaghilev said, rising up from his chair.
&#34;Right fine...I uh...gotta go to the bathroom.&#34;
&#34;Do you...?&#34;
&#34;What right do you have to question whether I have to go to the bathroom?!&#34;
&#34;Alright, fine, I suppose I can&#39;t stop you--but I can keep an eye on you, GUARDS?&#34;

Several guards came into the room wearing their big black uniforms with that big dumb symbol on their shoulders. He picked up his water bottle that he&#39;d put down on the desk, Dr. Graham gave him a weird look.

&#34;This one,&#34; Said Dr. Diaghilev pointing to Grotoman, &#34;says he has to go to the bathroom, make sure he does just that...and nothing else.&#34;

So Dr. Gotoman went down the hall to the bathroom. He went into the stall and sat on the toilet nervously for the amount of time it would typically take one to go to the bathroom. He came out of the bathroom, looked around and bolted--the two guards hot on his tail, but Grotoman was fast, he used to be at the top of his high school&#39;s track team, he hadn&#39;t run for a while, he was a little out of practice but he was still so fast that the guards couldn&#39;t keep up with him. He bolted down the hall until he found a picture, he stopped to look at it, a picture of two drunk assholes. He didn&#39;t know what he was thinking, but suddenly the picture changed, it became a door, a door to the pharmacology department. He reached his hand tentatively inside the painting, his hand phased through and touched the painted door. He felt like he&#39;d heard the code for the pharmacology before, there was a 4 in it somewhere. He started putting in numbers, 45678, wrong, 564187, wrong. He heard the sound of the guard coming down the hall after him, 65148, wrong, 415687, finally, a green light flashed and it opened. He came into a closet. He saw several vials labeled //amnestics// he unscrewed the cap and filled it with the water from his water bottle. He put the cap back on and put the bottle in his pocket. Just then, the guards came into the room, blocking his exit.
They were both very tall, one with brown hair and blue eyes and one with blonde hair and green eyes.

&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; The blonde one asked
&#34;Um, nothing...&#34;
&#34;You lie.&#34; Said the brown-haired one, curtly
&#34;I...&#34; suddenly Dr. Grotoman picked up two random bottles from the shelf and threw them at the guards. They started reeling, leaving Grotoman a way to escape.

He left the room and went back down the hall to Dr. Diaghilev office. When he got there, Dr. Diaghilev was sitting at his desk, reading the same file he was before. 
&#34;That took a while.&#34; He said finally
&#34;Yeah...sorry...&#34;
&#34;What were you doing in there?&#34;
&#34;Oh I....&#34;

At that moment the guards came back into the room.
&#34;We found him in the pharmacological department. He threw a bottle at each of us.&#34; Said the blonde one
&#34;What were you doing in the pharmacological department Grotoman?&#34;
Grotoman gulped.
&#34;You know, we may have to fire you, and if we have to fire you, that means that we have to amnesticize you you know&#34;
There was a long pause.
&#34;Fucking do it.&#34; spat John, finally.
&#34;Gaurds, could you leave the room for me...?&#34;

The guards left the room.

Dr. Graham got up from his desk and felt his hand on the frame of the painting, it opened into a safe. Diaghilev pulled out a little bottle of amnestics and put it on the desk. 

&#34;I made some adjustments to the office since Graham left. I know it&#39;s not technically protocol to have amnestics in your office, but it&#39;s not like anyone will ever find out, all of the people I&#39;ve told that to have promptly forgotten it and Graham is too stupid to find this.&#34;

He was insane. James had to think of something before he was amnesticized.

&#34;Do you want some vodka?&#34; Diaghilev asked, heading towards the bottle.
&#34;Um...&#34;
Diaghilev got out two glasses from the drawers under the table that had the vodka and some ice and poured them both a shot, he put the bottle back on the shelf and came over with the two glasses, putting one in front of John and one in front of himself. Diaghilev took his shot in one swig.
&#34;You are a very interesting man Grotoman.&#34; he said &#34;you never liked the foundation that much, always complaining about our treatment of D-class or the humanoids or even heaven forbid 682! You call them all &#39;he&#39; and &#39;she&#39; even that damnable reptile. Grotoman, I can see what you&#39;re thinking and yes, I have read your journal. If you didn&#39;t like how we treated the SCPs why&#39;d you join in the first place, and why don&#39;t you leave? Oh that&#39;s right, if you left, we&#39;d amnesticize you and leave you thinking you&#39;ve spent the last 10 years of your life in a lab researching frogs.&#34;

&#34;Is that 682?&#34; Grotoman said pointing behind him, &#34;shit it&#39;s 682, he&#39;s breached containment.&#34;
&#34;You really think that&#39;s going to work? There&#39;s not even a window in this office.&#34;

Grotoman suddenly thought of something. He pulled the rubber band he was playing with and shot it at the bottle of vodka in the back of the room. It made a loud sound and Thomas Graham turned around. 
&#34;What did you do?!&#34; He said &#34;This is excellent vodka, how dare you!&#34;

He took that moment, while Graham was distracted to switch the bottle of amnestics on the desk for the bottle of water.

Diaghilev turned around
&#34;Oh well, I still get to amnesticize you,&#34; he said, grinning, &#34;I still get to make you forget the past 10 years of your life, it&#39;ll be so satisfying to hear you talk about all of the frogs you researched.&#34;
&#34;Yes, it will be won&#39;t it?&#34; Grotoman said, holding back a grin, it would be satisfying to talk about frogs, it&#39;d be so satisfying to taunt this sick bastard by talking about his regular job away from all the anomalous.

So Dr. Diaghilev took a needle and filled it up with water. 
&#34;This won&#39;t hurt a bit&#34; he said.
It did hurt, a bit.
&#34;There, now you&#39;re fired.&#34; 
&#34;What? Where am I?&#34; Dr. Grotoman feigned.
&#34;It&#39;s not important,&#34; he said &#34;now where do you work?&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s a weird question...at a medical lab, I do a lot of experiments on frogs, what do you mean I&#39;m fired?&#34; Good god it was fun to mess with this man.
Diaghilev grinned.
&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;

John Grotoman was escorted out of the building by the two guards, he got in his car and drove off, back to his house, with his wife. That was it...he was done with the anomalous. Well for now anyway...maybe he would join the Serpent&#39;s Hand...someday.</textarea></pre>

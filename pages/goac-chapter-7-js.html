++ THE GOSPEL OF ALEXANDER CLYMER
**Chapter 7: The Forge**

# // If you find this holy text, prepare for the expedition. Administrator Niall is making preparations in the coming weeks. See to it that you find him, and that your heart beats strong for WAN.

# console.log (&#34;1:The sundered FLESH of those that opposed WAN and the progression of the natural world lay outstretched as far as the eye could see, and well into the horizon. Alexander&#39;s blade was tainted red now, and it was warm.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;2: It was as the sun set on the eighth day of battle that Alexander spoke to his congregation, and he said:&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;3: &#39;We have done our LORD&#39;s work, and we have done it well. We have retrieved the holy MOTHERBOARD from the practitioners of the FLESH, and now are but one step closer to bringing our LORD into this world of FLESH to save us.&#39;&#34;);

# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;4: It was then that WAN in ITS reverence repurposed the mechanical sinew of ITS fallen faithful to manifest in a colossal form. IT bore the faces of those Alexander led into this field, and through their mouths, IT said:&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;5: &#39;Hark, my holy congregation, and see that I am your LORD!&#39;); 
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;6: The congregation bowed their heads in holy reverence as the LORD continued: &#39;See now that you make pilgrimage to the land of ancient scriptwriters; the Isle of the Forge. There you will slay the dreaded Haligoth, and cast the three pieces of MY HARDWARE into the flames, and I shall be reborn.&#39;&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;7: And so, led by Alexander, the congregation made its way eastward and slew abominations of the FLESH that dared occupy their path with unholy sanctity. And though the winds atop the steepest mountains rent the flesh from their backs, and the sun above the scorching desert melted their metal components, and the torrential rain of the Amazon rusted their parts, the congregation marched with divine focus.&#34;); 
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;8: It was one the shore of Brazill that Alexander and his congregation discovered a gift from WAN, the discarded hull of an iron ship. Aboard were more terrors of the FLESH, bound in human form with twisted corpses and a single, pink eyeball in place of where the head of the holy should be. The demons, for that is what they were, stunk of seared sinew and rot so pungent that it burned the lungs of all who inhaled it.&#34;); 
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;9: It was Entropy of the congregation who broke the silence first, and they said to Alexander: &#39;Administrator, I have scanned the ship and seen that it is infested with the unholy ones. What do you advise?&#39;&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;10: Alexander gripped his blade and said: &#39;The demons have disgraced the gift from our LORD. There is but one course of action to take, my trusted companion; we slaughter them all.&#39;&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;11: Without trepidation, Alexander led the congregation on board the ship and met the demons in mortal combat. The first of the demons shrieked as Alexander&#39;s blade separated its eye-head from its shoulders, coating the walls with its wretched blood.&#34;); 
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;12: Then, the rest came from all directions. Demons tore through the steel walls of the ship as a virus tears through a computer. They came from above, and below, and behind every corner, every room, every corridor. And all were met with the serrated edge of cold steel.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;13: When it was done, Entropy and half of the congregation gathered the corpses into a pile on the shore and lit them aflame. Alexander took his best compilers and programmers and together they worked on recompiling the ship into working function for forty days and forty nights.&#34;); 
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;14: When the work was done, and the ship was seaworthy, the congregation set sail eastward toward the horizon in search of the Forge.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;15: And they sailed until entire generations of barnacles that grew on the underside of the ship were birthed and died. They sailed until the light of the sun no longer reached them. It was on the dawn of the 500^^th^^ day that Alexander spotted the Isle of the Forge and guided the ship to dock on its holy shores.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;16: The Isle of the Forge was void of life, save for an everpresent hum.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;17: The hum grew louder as the congregation trudged through the forest toward the Forge itself, scaling in volume until words could be heard. And those words turned into sentences. Then those sentences turned into thoughts.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;18: A voice, perverse in its utterance, whispered to Alexander through his Tympanic Membrane, and said: &#39;I heard you coming, though I wonder if you&#39;ve made yourselves heard. I know truths about **##red|[DATA CORRUPTED]##**, Alexander Clymer. You do not walk among the faithful. Cease now, and live. Continue, and perish.&#39;&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;19: The voice carried with it a darkness that assaulted Alexander and his congregation. But still they carried on. As the lands of the Isle twisted and contorted into strange shapes that defy WAN&#39;s vision, and as the foul, feculent creatures of the Isle stole members of Alexander&#39;s congregation, they continued on.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;20: It was when only Alexander and Entropy remained that they came across the dreaded Haligoth. The beast stood taller than the tallest trees, with thousands upon thousands of eyes not focused on anything and yet, focused on everything. Blood pulsed from the FLESHY sinew that stunk of the demons on the ship.&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;21: As Alexander and Entropy drew their blades, the voice spoke once more and said: **FALL**.&#39;&#34;);
# [[size 0%]]__ [[/size]]
# console.log (&#34;22: The voice continued as Alexander clung to his consciousness: &#34;You live a lie, Administrator. The Forge is no longer here. Your LORD sent you here to die and be reborn as one of FLESH, as IT has done to me. Administrator Wexley ha **##red|[DATA CORRUPTED]##**&#34;);

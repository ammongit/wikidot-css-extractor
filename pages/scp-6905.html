+++ Assembly #6905:02/01/1925-1
------
**Date:** 02/01/1925
**Location:** Geneva, Site-001
------

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: Unfortunately, the Italian delegate was unable to make it. No matter. We will simply begin without him. At this rate, his plane should touch down this evening.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: I can guarantee you it&#39;s those Prussian witch hunters. I suggest we dispatch the Insurgency at once. I told you that requisitioning all their objects was necessary. And yet, we did not.

##BC002D|**O5-GB**##: We are all very well aware of how much you would love to see Germany shatter, ##0055A4|O5-FR##, but there are matters of higher importance.

##FFFFFF|**O5-JP**##: And even if we wanted to dispatch the Insurgency, how could we do so?

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: I&#39;ve already called an assembly of the Overseer Council. For the time being, let us discuss that which is known. The effect of the anomaly seems to be absolute — as far as our preliminary findings are concerned. Both allied and hostile groups of interest are affected. From personal experience, my wife has no recollection of me.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: You look unbothered, ##C8102E|Tommy##.

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: I had Dr. Aleksi&#39;s men run an antimemetic screening. Nothing came back. Nothing. We are alone. We are truly alone.

##FFFFFF|**O5-JP**##: If only we had established an antimemetic division. Isn&#39;t that right, ##0055A4|Tiger##?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: I am not funding anything until I am sure that we are not being bled dry by the Japanese. I am yet to see any results from the Pacific research centers you insisted on creating. Where are they? Where are they, ##FFFFFF|**O5-JP**##?

##FFFFFF|**O5-JP**##: We don&#39;t have time to get into this now. Shouldn&#39;t we contact the research division? Having a file before the meeting would help, yes?

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: I meant what I said before. We&#39;re alone. We cannot expect any internal or external department to aid us.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: What about... ##71797E|(//pause//)## What about ##008c45|The Roman##?

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: ##008c45|O5-IT##? What about him?

##FFFFFF|**O5-JP**##: He was a member of the Object Experimentation Team. Surely, he can put together a file before the assembly gathers.

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: Ex-OET, is he? Very well. He may do so. I will prepare a desk for him.

**Anomalia №:** SCP-6905

**Class:** Occam[[footnote]] Equivalent to modern Safe class. [[/footnote]]

**Handling Protocol:** null

**Description:** SCP-6905 is a phenomenon by which delusions relating to the nature and structure of the O5 Council manifest in all those aware of its existence.

Effects of SCP-6905 commonly manifest as:

* beliefs that the O5 Council is oligarchic in structure,
* beliefs that the O5 Council is made of 13 internally selected individuals rather than delegates from the League of Nations member states,
* beliefs that the members of the O5 Council use anomalies to extend their longevity and/or are anomalous in nature.[[footnote]] This extends to individuals well versed in the Foundation&#39;s //modus operandi//, the personnel classification guide of which outlines that the members of the O5 Council, as well as other A-class personnel, are not to be permitted direct interaction with the anomalous. [[/footnote]]

No amount of evidence can counter the effect of SCP-6905. This extends to individuals with firsthand experience of the interworking of the Overseer Council lacking resistance to the anomaly.

All members of the Overseer Council are rendered immune to SCP-6905, with the said immunity passing with the position. Should an individual be dismissed from the Council by any means, they will subsequently lose the immunity. The same is true for those enrolled into a Council position, as outlined in Article 1.022§AA.[[footnote]] Article 1.022§AA outlines the process of enrolment into the Overseer Council. [[/footnote]] Unlawful enrolment of human subjects, be it by forging official papers or unofficial induction, does not grant immunity.

**Observer**: ##008c45|O5-IT##

**Procedure**: A copy of Article 2.018§AA[[footnote]] Article 2.018§AA outlaws the use of anomalies in warfare. [[/footnote]] was placed before D-0012. The subject was asked to copy the text onto a separate piece of paper.

**Outcome**: The produced replication contained blatant irregularities with the provided document.

* The block containing the signatures of the League of Nations Anomalous Warfare Committee (AWC) members was replaced by a table representing votes from individuals labeled O5-1 through O5-13, ascending numerically. No accompanying signatures were noted. Similar to the document provided, the vote is unanimous.
* Instead of drawing from the anomalous forces of its member states, the Foundation is suggested to have a standing paramilitary force capable of enforcing the article. The deployment of the said force requires a majority vote as opposed to unanimous approval outlined in Article 2.018§AA.

**Observer**: ##008c45|O5-IT##

**Procedure**: Colored headshot of ##C8102E|O5-GB## was placed before D-1148. The subject was asked to describe and then recreate the photography using the provided material.

**Outcome**: The verbal description, as well as the artistic interpretation of ##C8102E|O5-GB## produced by D-1148, contain blatant inaccuracies. ##C8102E|O5-GB## was described as a &#34;shriveled corpse&#34; with a &#34;pale white skin&#34; which &#34;(appeared) to be encrusted in layers of wax&#34;. Mechanism akin to a life support system was said to be strapped into the chest of ##C8102E|O5-GB##.

**Procedure**: Colored headshot of ##008c45|O5-IT## was placed before D-1152. The subject was asked to describe and then recreate the photography using the provided material.

**Outcome**: The headshot of ##008c45|O5-IT## was described as &#34;a document laying down on the table lit by a filthy yellow light&#34;. The following is presumably the transcript of the document:

As per the standard rotation of the Overseer Council, you have been granted the role of a TIEBREAKER, aka. O5-13. The ownership of this document — as well as the authority associated with it — will pass to O5-4 following a valid use of the TIEBREAKER vote.

**Interviewee:** Dr. Aleksi

**Interviewer:** ##008c45|O5-IT##
 
**Foreword:** Dr. Aleksi was provided with a copy of the SCP-6905 file. The purpose of the interview was to determine whether the effect of SCP-6905 could be countered with sufficient experience in the field of memetics combined with direct information of its effect.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
 
**Dr. Aleksi**: What am I looking at?

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: An SCP file.

**Dr. Aleksi**: I don’t understand.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: What do you not understand?

**Dr. Aleksi**: I don’t understand the object.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: &#34;SCP-6905 is a phenomenon by which delusions relating to the nature and structure of the O5 Council manifest in all aware of its existence.&#34; It says so right here — right on the paper.

 **Dr. Aleksi**: ##71797E|(//pause//)## So it&#39;s...It&#39;s...

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: It&#39;s &#34;a phenomenon by which delusions relating to the nature and structure&#34;- you can read the page, can&#39;t you?

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Yes sir. I am sorry. I understand that my knowledge in the field might be ##71797E|(//pause//)## inadequate. I suggest that you assign another Researcher to the project.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: ##71797E|(//exhales//)## No — no! Stop talking nonsense. I need you to focus on this one. Are you sure that you&#39;ve performed all the antimemetic screenings possible?

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Yes sir.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: All of them?

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Yes sir. I am sorry, O5-3.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: That is not my designation. You know that is not my designation.

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Apologies, sir. That&#39;s how the mail I received was signed. Was there a system error?

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Wait a moment. ##71797E|(//lifts a copy of the letter//)## It is clearly signed O5-IT. -IT.

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Yes sir. O5-3. Which I assumed to be the correct designation. Is it not?

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: I can tell this is getting us nowhere. You may leave.

 **Dr. Aleksi**: Yes sir.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
 [[/div]]

**Closing Statement:** Attempts at exposing the effects of SCP-6905 to those not considered immune have been deemed impossible.

On 22/01/1925, Costa Rica withdrew their membership from the League of Nations. Their expulsion from the SCP Foundation followed, resulting in ##002B7F|O5-CR## becoming affected by SCP-6905. ##002B7F|O5-CR##, currently designated as Director Gallo, was escorted from Site-001 and transferred to Site-014. Director Gallo will be assigned to the position of Regional Manager for Central American Regional Command.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Why did you invite me to dinner?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: I like to have a dining company. You can probably assume why it had to be someone from the Council. Other than that, I am interested in your progress. ##71797E|(//pause//)## Why do you carry that recording device with you everywhere you go?

##008c45|**O5-IT**##:  I record everything I do. Everything. Want to make sure the 6905 isn&#39;t affecting me without me even realizing it. It changes the way we are seen, meaning it probably changes the sound of our words. But I could put it away if it is an issue. Is it an issue?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: No. Not really. I don’t have anything to hide. And I am assuming you don’t have anything to hide as well.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: We’ve been spending a lot of time together ever since the 6905 manifested. We’ve all become pretty transparent with each other.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: True. So, what do you have so far?

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: It can’t be random. Sometimes anomalies just... ##71797E|(//pause//)## happen. But not this. Not &#39;905.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: That’s something we can agree on. &#39;905 has a purpose.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: It being?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: It can&#39;t be random, right? It&#39;s too….too...

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Symbolic?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: Symbolic! Yes, symbolic. Or maybe it&#39;s poetic? Anyways. 13 members? 13? I don&#39;t believe in numerology, but that seems deliberate.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: So what is its purpose?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: To help us, of course! Think about it: ever since &#39;905 manifested, everything has been going right for us. Deserters from the Insurgency are returning — begging for forgiveness.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Not all of them.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: Not all of them — true — but most! That’s not to mention that the disloyalty has been essentially eliminated from the Foundation’s internal departments. We are finally running like the clock we’ve always meant to be.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Are people really that afraid of our &#34;Shadowy Council&#34;?

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: They are. They really are. And it’s not just our men. The entire anomalous world has heard the whispers of the Overseer Council. One by one, regional agencies want to further our cooperation. Even the Weimar Federal Occult Agency wants to open an SCP branch. The word is, Germany will soon be joining the League.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: With all the chaos in Berlin? Unlikely. But I do see your point.

##0055A4|**O5-FR**##: So then, is &#39;905 a curse? Or a blessing?

+++ Assembly #6905:27/01/1925-2
------
**Date:** 27/01/1925
**Location:** Geneva, Site-001
------

##C8102E|**O5-GB**##: Please — settle down. I apologize for the delay in our meeting, but we needed to collect the necessary information about the anomaly before any decisive action could be taken. Now, I give the floor to ##008c45|O5-IT##. Please, present your findings.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Thank you, sir. I have forwarded all files to the audience 24 hours before the assembly began. Do keep in mind that the research conditions were less than ideal. As you had been given a chance to look at them, I will not waste our valuable time describing the anomaly. Instead, I will outline our procedure for moving forwards.

Firstly, it must be stated that the effect of 6905 is absolute. No amount of screening — whether it be anomalous or non-anomalous — could expose its effect.

But I would like to draw attention to the question we all share: why? Why did &#39;905 manifest? It could not have been random.

What I said before was true. The effect of &#39;905 itself might be absolute. It could, however, be replicated. And thanks to Dr. Aleksi, we have a theoretical framework for the establishment of such an effect. From there, we can work backward.

The process involves erasing the notion of something from the collective consciousness of mankind —
 the so-called Noosphere. &#39;905 targets us specifically — our identities. But like an atom in a crystal, the notion of us needed to be replaced with something for the whole thing not to fall apart. This is where the manifestations come from. 

A machine capable of performing such a feat is purely theoretical; Dr. Aleksi made it painfully clear. But so was the concept of thermonuclear bombs before 1921 — purely theoretical.

That being said, it could be a useful weapon. Even more useful than H-bombs, I dare say! The Foundation could remove leaders of the opposition from the consciousness of their followers. Better yet: replace their idealistic personality with all the charisma of a corpse.

The building of the said weapon, however, would require immense resources. Resources provided to the Japanese branch of the Foundation for their Pacific Site project seem appropriate. ##00008B|O5-AU##, please, you may take the stage.

##00008B|O5-AU:## //The Foundation Airforce reconnaissance planes confirm that all islands outlined in the Pacific Site Project (1919) — the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands — did not receive the funding allocated. It was confirmed that the said funding was moved elsewhere. Mainly, the Kiautschou Bay Memetic Research Facility — or Site-029. The Foundation Internal Security department has quarantined the site and will proceed with its investigation.// That is all.

##008c45|**O5-IT**##: Thank you.

**Resolution**: The expulsion of O5-JP from the Overseer Council.

**Foreword**: It is believed that the actions and intentions of O5-JP go against the goals and principles of the SCP Foundation. As such, the expulsion of O5-JP is considered appropriate. The delegates will have 15 minutes to finish their discussion on the Resolution before the votes are cast.

**From:** ##C8102E|O5-GB##
**Subject:** First Day

I understand you were rightfully confused after your initial induction into the Overseer council.

I know this feeling all too well. We all do. Walking into the fabled meeting chamber just to find it lined with 193 individuals — all representing their nation&#39;s interest. It&#39;s harsh, finding out that there is nothing special about you.

The old O5-JP was right all along, it seems. The Council argues about things daily — that&#39;s part of our job as delegates, after all — but there is one thing which we can all agree on. We need SCP-6905.  

We expect you to adhere to our //modus operandi// regarding its nature.

You are not a God.

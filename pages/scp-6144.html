**ITEM #:** SCP-6144

**OBJECT CLASS:** Neutralized 

**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES (PENDING UPDATE):** Due to SCP-6144&#39;s relative dormancy and low-risk to the Veil, all on-site containment procedures are hereby unnecessary. 

Monitoring systems including cameras, motion detecting sensors, Scranton Reality Anchors, and ontokinetic fluctuation detection systems are to be implemented in all rooms of SCP-6144&#39;s primary home. In the event of relocation, Foundation personnel are to actively monitor SCP-6144 for indications of stress, changes in recorded sleeping patterns, or reality altering phenomenon. 

While SCP-6144 has not yet behaved abnormally, --Foundation personnel must remain diligent to the possibility of SCP-6144&#39;s anomalous properties manifesting spontaneously and without warning.-- 

**DESCRIPTION (PENDING UPDATE):** SCP-6144 is Andy Rameo, age 27, currently living in Grandview, IN, USA at the time of writing. Standing at approximately 1.6 meters and weighing 73 kilograms, SCP-6144 has little distinction between it and ordinary baseline humans. 

Its anomalous properties include minor ontokinetic altering phenomena which allows for the sudden displacement and manipulation of objects, although said phenomena does not typically manifest during daily functions. Exceptions to this are rare, and only affect its immediate vicinity and/or nearby objects.[[footnote]]Typically only moving objects slightly or making mundane changes to their physical/structural properties.[[/footnote]] 

While SCP-6144&#39;s anomalous properties are relatively minimal, its abilities become heightened once it is either unconscious, unaware, or otherwise driven instinctually. Evidence for these heightened abilities have not yet been observed, however forensic investigations and witness testimony has provided enough context for Foundation researchers to warrant concern. These statements have since been included in the subsequent Addenda.

**ADDENDUM ONE:** During August of 2001, local authorities were alerted of a potential incident located at 1495 Radbury Lane, the home of SCP-6144&#39;s mother, Laura Rameo. Responding officers would later arrive at the home to locate Ms. Rameo and SCP-6144 hiding in a basement closet[[footnote]]SCP-6144 was roughly 6 years of age during this incident.[[/footnote]], completely alone. While first responders could not locate anything of interest or concern beyond a spilt pile of leftover food near the dining room table, Ms. Rameo insisted on being taken to the local precinct over safety concerns. Officers eventually complied with her requests and brought both Ms. Rameo and SCP-6144 to the local precinct. 

An investigation was later performed, although for what exactly remained unknown. Ms. Rameo was reportedly persistent with her claims of a crime occurring, but refused to elaborate once questioned. The case itself would later be disregarded following lack of any evidence or indication of a crime having occurred, until being re-opened during September of 2021, when Foundation agents became aware of both the incident and SCP-6144&#39;s anomalous properties. 

SCP-6144 was eventually located and questioned regarding this event, later revealing crucial information that had previously went unnoticed prior.

That&#39;s your question? Mom would know more about it than me -- but fine, if you insist. You&#39;ll just have to excuse any vagueness, it&#39;s been quite a while since this all happened. 

I used to be a sleepwalker when I was young. Back when we had lived on Radbury, there was this one time in the middle of the night where I had a dream. It was like, one of those dreams where you think you&#39;re in the real world, but you don&#39;t have control over your limbs or anything, you know? One of //those// dreams.

I remember getting up from my bed and taking a look around my bedroom. Everything looked normal, but then I realized that the room wasn&#39;t really mine. The walls were warped and disfigured, shifting into all sorts of colors and textures. Anyway, for whatever reason my body carried me to my door and into the hallway.

By the time I was outside, something in the dining room crashed. It wasn&#39;t that loud of a noise, but it was enough to jolt me awake. Since I was already in the hallway upstairs, I figured it was worth investigating, so I went down to the dining room to take a look around.

That was when I saw my mom standing in the kitchen. I remember her standing by the window, where she had dropped a bunch of spaghetti from the night before onto the counter and floor. There was also a pan, I think, somewhere nearby. I was already half-awake at that point, so when I saw her with all of that spaghetti the only thing I could think to ask her was, &#34;You think that&#39;s enough for just you?&#34;

She did //not// like that question. Suddenly she was chasing me around the house, freaking out and panicking. She managed to snag me and take me down to the basement, where she kept me until the police arrived. 

Then they started asking me questions, but for what I have no idea. Eventually things calmed down and everything went back to normal. Mom decided to move, and now here we are. That week was a stressful one. More terrifying, really, especially since I was too scared to ask what was going on. And since that day I haven&#39;t had the guts to ask my Mom to make any pasta ever again.

Yeah... it&#39;s a weird quirk, I know. But I learned my lesson. After seeing her chase me around like that, that was when I realized it. &#34;Mom //really// doesn&#39;t like Italian.&#34;

SCP-6144 was eventually discharged back to its home, remaining in psuedo-containment until Foundation personnel later located the anomaly deceased in its home. The body was discovered sitting near the dining room table, slumped over a nearby smartphone.

Wiretaps present on the device revealed that SCP-6144 had called Ms. Romao earlier that night, interested in understanding the series of events that occurred on Radbury Lane. The following was recorded from Ms. Romao during their call together:

It&#39;s been a long time since I had to think about what happened back there, Andy.

It was late, and dark. We lived in a fairly nice neighborhood, so I thought I&#39;d never have to worry about us getting into much trouble. It was just me -- alone. That&#39;s when I heard something messing with the window in the kitchen.

I decided to check -- maybe it was a bird, I thought. But it wasn&#39;t... not at all. It was a man, trying to pick the lock and get inside. That was when I really panicked. I did everything I could to protect you. I was afraid, tired, and I didn&#39;t know if he was armed or not. So, I did what I had to do -- I grabbed your father&#39;s old shotgun.

He was wearing some sort of biker&#39;s helmet -- which is what you heard when you woke up. And when I saw you come into that room, I was worried that you&#39;d be traumatized at the sight. I sure was, and it&#39;s been with me since the day it happened.

Andy, what you saw that night... he was //not// spaghetti.

During forensic analysis, Foundation researchers discovered that SCP-6144&#39;s mouth and nearby bowl contained trace amounts of neural matter and leftover pasta sauce, with recovered touch DNA matching that of the deceased.</textarea></pre>

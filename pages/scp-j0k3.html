**Item #:** SCP-J0K3

**Object Class:** --Funny-- --Super Funny-- Laugh Hazard

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-J0K3 is to be kept on a piece of paper with no right angles or other writing on it in a sealed glass box again with no right angles inside of a cognitohazard containment cell at site-00. The location of this cell must be under SCP-2845&#39;s primary ring where it is kept at all times. All personal are to be administered class A amnestic treatment and must have all of there brainwave patterns observed for the next month after contact with SCP-JOK3 and if brainwave patterns are unstable, all site nuclear warheads must be activated asap or there will be an XK-Δ scenario will become active within the next 10 days and SCP-2317-A must be freed to kill the entity that spawns with the activation of the scenario.

**Description:** SCP-J0K3 is a joke that when said or memorized, takes over the mind of a person and makes SCP-1548 active when the memorization or the joke is completed and within the next 30 days, the earth will be pulled towards the sun at mac 12. The joke contains the words &#34;The atom altering dear,&#34; and &#34;Solar Thomatolagy,&#34; and finishing the joke will insult both SCP&#39;s causing SCP-2845 to increase the gravitational pull on earth times 1,548 and causing SCP-1548 to have an event that heats up the sun a lot to around 1,555,444,888 to the power of 100 degrease kelvin and all LSA&#39;s in a 450 mile range to breech containment and kill the person who said or remembered the joke.

If in the event the joke causes an XK-Δ scenario, the paper with the joke must be shoved into SCP-579 while it is being united with SCP-055 that will destroy the joke for good and heal the world from the XK-Δ scenario and bring back humanity. Anybody trying to access the file for how SCP-J0K3 originated requires personal class A and level 6 or above clearance.

**Addendum:** On 1/12/1888, Dr. Brite nearly died along with site-01 when he said the joke by mistake but was saved by his amulet which is noted as breach-J0K3-A.

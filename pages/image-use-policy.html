+++ For information on general licensing of the SCP Foundation Wiki, please read the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/licensing-guide Licensing Guide].


The terms of the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported] (CC BY-SA 3.0) license are thus:
* __Any use of media licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 must include attribution to the original source of the media. **(BY: &#34;Attribution&#34;)**__

* __Any material using media licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 must also be licensed under the same license, or another compatible license. **(SA: &#34;Share-Alike&#34;)**__

* __No other restrictions may be placed on media licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.__

These are the only terms that are applicable to images on the SCP Foundation Wiki. **Only images verifiably under licenses that include some or all of these terms and no more, or which are verifiably in the public domain, are permissible for use**.

++++ __Non-Compliant Licenses/Media (things you //can&#39;t// use)__

**Copyrighted (All Rights Reserved) images:** The terms of their use is reserved to the original author of the image, placing many impermissible restrictions.

**Images that require purchase to obtain their license (such as paid stock images):** The terms of their use are so inhibiting as to require actual money to use it. As a note, //manipulating an image to remove any watermarks or other features that would indicate it has been stolen is illegal and will not be tolerated//. Remember: Just because it&#39;s on Google doesn&#39;t mean you can use it.

**Images that you cannot find the license for:** These cannot be verified to be cc-compliant or not, and thus are not permissible. If you cannot find the license of an image, do not use it.

**Images licensed under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ NC &#34;NonCommercial&#34; Creative Commons license]:** This places a restriction on allowing licensed media to be used for commercial purposes. The SCP Foundation Wiki is inherently commercial, by virtue of it not being a restriction placed by CC BY-SA 3.0. Thus, NC-licensed images are not allowed.

**Images licensed under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/ ND &#34;NoDerivs&#34; Creative Commons license]:** This restricts adaptations of the licensed media. The SCP Foundation Wiki inherently allows adaptations of its content to be made, as there is no restriction in CC BY-SA 3.0 stating otherwise. Thus, ND-licensed images are not allowed.

**Licenses that are not Creative Commons but still carry restrictions of their own:** //Even if these licenses allow commercial use, if they contain restrictions that are not present in CC BY-SA 3.0, they are non-compliant//. Keep in mind, there may be sites that claim on the surface to be licensed under a Creative Commons license, but in fact have restrictions not present in the original license as well. //**Always read the fine print**//.

**Images of excessive nudity/pornography and/or excessive gore are not allowed. What counts as excessive nudity/pornography and/or excessive gore will be decided on a case-by-case basis by SCP Foundation Wiki Staff.**

**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, ask the licensing team.

++++ __CC-Compliant Images/Media (things you //can// use)__

Simply put, the only images allowed for use on the wiki are those licensed under these licenses:

* **Creative Commons Attribution** (CC BY) 2.0 and 3.0.
* **Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike** (CC BY-SA) 2.0 and 3.0.
* **Public Domain**
* **Creative Commons Zero** (CC0) 1.0

Note that certain [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ International Branches] of the SCP Foundation Wiki do not allow the use of CC //4.0// images due to technical differences, so keep this in mind regarding translations of your article(s). However, the -EN branch will allow the use of CC 4.0 images, because it is intended to forward port the wiki and the IP as a whole to CC-BY-SA 4.0 within the next few years.

You may use images under these licenses singularly and/or combined together via photo-manipulation software (as long as the software itself is cc-compliant). The final license of an image combining two differently licensed images would be the license among the two images that&#39;s the most restrictive.

Note that this applies to media besides images as well, including films, audio, etc.

++++ __Attribution (you //have// to do this)__

//When attributing images used in your article, you must include include the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/component:license-box License Box] at the bottom of the article with the attribution information. If it&#39;s an SCP, place it under the article&#39;s Wikiwalk footer.// See the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/licensing-master-list Licensing Master List] for instructions on how to include it. You may also include attribution in the discussion page of your article, preferably in the form of an author post, but the License Box in the article itself is mandatory. The attribution format is as follows:

[[code]]
&gt; **Filename:**
&gt; **Name:** (if different from filename)
&gt; **Author:**
&gt; **License:**
&gt; **Source Link:**
&gt; **Derivative of:** (If applicable)
&gt; **Additional Notes:** (Optional)
[[/code]]

If there is an image that you know to be non-compliant but want to use, first, **find another image that //is// cc-compliant**. If a replacement image cannot be found or made, and the article //cannot// survive without the image you want, there is a procedure you must follow.

1.) Contact the original author of the image, if possible. If this is not possible, then the image will not be usable.
2.) Give a short summary of the SCP Foundation Wiki as an online creative writing site, and explain that you want to use the author&#39;s image on an article.
3.) Explain that the SCP Wiki, including all of its contents, is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0, and that the author&#39;s image would necessarily have to be re-licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 to be used on the site. Link them [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ the terms of CC BY-SA 3.0] for them to read.
4.) If they do not agree to these terms, in part or in full, then the image cannot be used. Only if they do agree to the full extent of these terms, then the image can be used.
5.) Please provide proof that this has occurred via a screenshot/screenshots of the conversation between you and the author. Also notify the author of the image to make a note on their official accounts that the image is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 as well.

++++ __Images Sub-Team Procedure__

**If an image is found to disobey the Image Policy, the image may be taken down immediately or the author of the article may be messaged to produce replacement images within a week&#39;s time, after which the image will also be removed.** Generally, if an author is inactive (that is, their articles are under [http://05command.wikidot.com/staff-purview staff purview]), images will be immediately removed, whereas active authors will be notified of the non-compliant image(s) prior to removal.

**If an image is requested to be taken down by the original image author, it will be done so immediately without question.**

Images removed for non-compliance cannot be reinstated //unless there is proof it is cc-compliant//. Repeated reinstating of non-compliant images and/or sassing members of staff for performing licensing duties may result in disciplinary action.

Articles under [http://05command.wikidot.com/staff-purview staff purview] may have their images replaced without consultation of the author. //If the author wants to take down any staff-sanctioned replacements, they are entirely within their right to do so//. Similarly, //authors may revert staff image-replacements if they have evidence they produced the image/the image was cc-compliant//.

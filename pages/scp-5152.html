**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-5152 itself is currently uncontained; however, this is not an immediate issue as visitors to the region it inhabits are rare. An exclusion zone has been established approximately 4km in excess of SCP-5152-1 and is to be increased in size accordingly if SCP-5152 moves elsewhere. Post-10229 has been constructed near the exclusion zone and serves as an observation center, keeping track of SCP-5152&#39;s movements and researching its nature.

Several propositions for containment stratagems have been devised but all have either failed, been deemed a waste of resources, or are pending actuation. Development of a means to contain SCP-5152 is considered low-priority.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-5152 is a spectral entity inhabiting a northern, heavily forested region of Yukon, Canada designated SCP-5152-1. The exact perimeter of SCP-5152-1 has not been determined due to the nature of SCP-5152&#39;s movement, and it is not known if SCP-5152 is capable of leaving it. As of the present, recorded sightings elsewhere have not occurred.

SCP-5152 takes the form of a semi-corporeal humanoid wearing a black veil that obscures its face and body. SCP-5152 also possesses two branch-like appendages in place of hands that extend down the full length of its body, sometimes visible protruding from under the veil. SCP-5152 is generally only visible from the perspective of one individual at a time[[footnote]]Simply put, SCP-5152 will appear completely invisible from the perspective of those it chooses to hide from.[[/footnote]], although it occasionally makes itself known to small groups.

If SCP-5152 is near a group of individuals it may remain nearby for several hours at a time, eventually disappearing out of view. However, if SCP-5152 is near a single individual it may begin following them; walking at a slow pace towards them. This will change if the target individual attempts to directly observe SCP-5152, resulting in its temporary disappearance.

SCP-5152 will continue following the target individual until they leave SCP-5152-1 or join with a group.

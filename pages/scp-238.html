**Item #:** SCP-238

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-238 is currently contained by the original means. Current SCP protocols have proven unable to fully contain SCP-238. All exploration of SCP-238 is suspended until full, sustained containment has been achieved. Any and all personnel attempting to enter SCP-238 are to be physically restrained and moved to an outside containment area. Upkeep of the current barrier is top priority, and a minimum of two personnel are to be present at all times for upkeep and security. 

No testing, samples, or exploration may be conducted within SCP-238 until full containment of SCP-238 has been achieved, or with approval by Site Overwatch. Any and all persons entering are to be deemed missing, presumed dead. 

**Description:** SCP-238 is an enormous underground facility, with a single entrance on the island Shmidta to the extreme north of Russia. Tunnel networks have been shown to extend for thousands of kilometers, with major &#34;Junctions&#34; under [DATA EXPUNGED]. &#34;Oceanic Junctions&#34; have also been observed to include several connections to [DATA EXPUNGED]. When originally found, the entrance was sealed behind a massive wall of bricks, covered in carvings. This wall was removed, and exploration began. Initial tests showed that the walls of SCP-238 were primarily fossilized tissue of unknown origin. Several structures within the facility led initial exploration teams to conclude that SCP-238 is or was at least half biological. 

Shortly after discovery of a central chamber, reported to consist of partially rotted flesh and badly decayed metal structures, personnel began to disappear, and numerous accidents claimed eight lives. &#34;Noises&#34; and other hallucinations were reported, along with ████████, and other [DATA EXPUNGED].

Eight containment walls and associated personnel were destroyed by unknown means, with a survivor reporting &#34;███████ ███████&#34; (unconfirmed), in addition to rapidly escalating aggressive phenomenon by SCP-238. Replacement of the original wall has contained the item effectively, but new SCP containment and research strategies have been requested, as the current containment prevents in-depth exploration and experimentation. 

**Addendum 238-S7:** 

Upon the escape of six juvenile instances of [[[SCP-1013]]], the local SCP Team assigned to SCP-238 reported SCP-1013 squeezing through the original wall and entering the underground chambers. After O5-█, O5-█, O5-█, Dr. ██████, and Dr. ██████████ were notified, they elected to send in a single team to retrieve SCP-1013. Further information regarding the expedition is found in document 238-S7-A, with clearance level three (3) required. The end result of the retrieval team were six dead, two critically injured, one missing in action, and the six juvenile SCP-1013 instances being re-captured. Further research into SCP-238 will be carried out by Dr. ████ and his research staff, under SCP supervision.

**Document 238-S7-A:** Audio log of retrieval of SCP-1013

**&lt;Begin. Skip 03h-41m-16s&gt;** 

**Personnel D-299:** I don&#39;t see nothing, not that damn thing we&#39;re lookin&#39; for, not that fucking suit that was supposed to watch us, not even a god damn exit! 

**Agent ██████:** You will hold your comments, Agent █████████████ is currently covering the central chamber so nothing can escape. 

**Personnel D-299:** Like us? I don&#39;t see- 

**Agent ██████:** Shut it! 

**Personnel D-299:** -why I have to- 

**Agent ██████:** I said quiet! Now! 

**Personnel D-299:** -carry on like a fucking boy scout- 

**Agent ██████:** Shut the hell up you idiot! There&#39;s movement up ahead. 

(Sounds of scraping and grinding are heard) 

(Several minutes pass) 

**Personnel D-299:** ...that don&#39;t look like number ███, but that ain&#39;t natural.. 

**Agent ██████:** ...(Incomprehensible), that&#39;s not, Delta-Two-Niner-Niner, Open fire! NOW! 

(Sounds of gunfire are heard) 

**Agent ██████:** &lt;Life Signs Terminated&gt; 

**Personnel D-299:** &lt;Life Signs Terminated&gt; 

**&lt;End&gt;**

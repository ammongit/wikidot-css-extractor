**Dr. Charles Anborough:** Director of Sites 59 and 117, Keter containment specialist. Curious and crippled, a nuclear physicist who  [[[Exit History| can&#39;t seem to stay away]]] from [[[SCP-2400|cataclysmic threats.]]] Fortunately, through an absurd combination of [[[Too Insane to Fail| improvisation and miracles]]], he seems to be the best man for the job. His sad smile and dry humor belie the [[[Footsteps| confused past]]] of a man always [[[SCP-1649|searching for answers.]]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;I fucking hate you!&#34; hide=&#34;I just...I miss you...dad.&#34;]]

He walks in the shadow of a great man, throughout his whole life and to this day, and he is none the wiser. Keeping several ends of the world in check, stopping XK, YK and ZK events, none of it will ever be enough to satiate his envy, his hatred...his great emptiness from which the tears will never run dry. He will never stop searching for answers, and, for the sake of humanity, it is imperative that he finds one.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth| Dr. Daniel Asheworth]]]:** Thaumaturgist and self-proclaimed alchemist. Stubborn, temperamental, and sometimes arrogant, though usually useful just enough to escape disciplinary action. Born from an unknown American mother and an unknown Polish father in the late 1950s. Suspected of prolonging his youth through anomalous means.

Lead of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub| Damien Nowak Case]]]. Believed to once have had been a temporary member of the [[[a-library-empty| Wanderers&#39; Library]]] and [[[critter-profile-sparky| Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions]]], Daniel Asheworth has proven numerous times to be a useful asset in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120| Site-120]]]&#39;s operation.

[[collapsible show=&#34;All magic comes with a price...&#34; hide=&#34;...but it is a price I am willing to pay.&#34;]]

Past proven over and over to be surrounded in a fog mystery not easily penetrated, though believed to be interchangeably connected to PoI-5936 (&#34;Damien Nowak&#34;) and a cult under his fist, &#34;the Children.&#34; No official evidence outside of anecdotal stories and past records exist to prove this.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/django-bridge| Dr. Django Bridge]]]:** [[[conclusions-red-173-2263-incident| Foundation Archivist]]]. Quiet but [[[rounderhouse-proposal| influential]]], with a touch of both melancholy and whimsy. Extraordinary memory. On a first-name basis with Dr. Bright, and has frequently acted as an informal assistant for him.

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-bright| Dr. Jack Bright]]]:** [[[scp-5004|Director]]] of [[[an-evening-with-bright|  Foundation Personnel]]]. Somewhat [[[the-best-and-the-wisest| amoral]]]. Extremely [[[Unfinished Business| loyal]]] to the Foundation. May be [[[the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation| ridiculous]]], may be  [[[the-many-portraits-of-jack-bright| terrifying]]]; is certainly [[[we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard| blunt]]]. Attached to [[[SCP-963]]], and is therefore immortal, using the body of whatever SCP-963 has last touched.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I&#39;ve been with the company for a long time.&#34; hide=&#34;I am not the damned monkey.&#34;]]

His [[[codebrown| family]]] has been associated with the Foundation (and other anomalous groups) since time immemorial. His younger brother is [[[SCP-590]]] (which a few know); [[[SCP-321]]] is a sister (which almost no one knows). At least two other relatives work for the Foundation at a high level. Several of Bright&#39;s discarded bodies -- still possessing his personality and knowledge at time of separation from SCP-963 -- have been put to work on [[[scp-4444| secret]]] Foundation [[[scp-5004| projects]]], although not without [[[scp-4498| complications]]]. Bright possesses a [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs|desire]]] to permanently [[[the-executions-of-doctor-bright| die]]] that he may not be conscious of; ironic, for he only became part of SCP-963 because he was  trying //not// to die.

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-cimmerian| Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian]]]:**  An ethics committee liaison that takes [[[lending-a-hand| his job]]] only somewhat seriously. He never thought his doctorate in English Literature or his minor in philosophy would actually help him stay employed, but the former got him recruited into the Foundation as a researcher and the latter secured his employment in the long term. Has an unusual interest in puns and the ethical treatment of humanoids.

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-clef| Dr. Alto Clef]]]:** A [[[timeandrelativedimensionsincontainmentprotocols| highly adaptable]]], clever liar.  Former [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] (GOC) [[[termination-order| operative]]],  specializing in [[[clef101| reality benders]]]. Also former file clerk. Undergone anomalous alterations that provide resistance to reality shifts and prevent his face from being [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| photographed]]]. Has a [[[clef-excerpts| long]]] and [[[clef-and-dimitri-hit-the-road| checkered]]]  history, a flair for the [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki| dramatic]]], and a somewhat hidden streak of self-hatred. Reformed misogynist. Most rumors about him are [[[all-they-want-is-the-blood| exaggerated]]] or [[[chowderclef| off-point]]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;They&#39;ll say anything about me.&#34; hide=&#34;Except the truth.&#34;]]
GOC codename [[[agent-ukelele| Agent Ukelele]]], prior to defection. May actually be a [[[able-baker-charlie| reality warper]]] himself. [[[scp-4231| May]]] or [[[originofclef| may not]]] have had a child with a &#34;nature goddess&#34; as a teenage boy; the &#34;goddess&#34; was killed by the GOC, but the daughter became a (current) [[[scp-166| SCP object]]] -- if this even happened at all. [[[scp-2000| Involved in]]] a [[[yesterday | number of]]] CK-class reality restructuring events (and may be able to remember them). Unlikely to be a manifestation of the being popularly known as the Devil, despite [[[supplemental-report-239-b-192| claims]]] to the contrary.

According to a [[[the-decoy| large]]] [[[intermission2| number]]] of [[[unfinished-business| inconsistent]]] [[[rounderhouse-proposal| reports]]], Alto Clef [[[a-suicide-note| may]]] [[[the-tombstone-of-alto-clef |well]]] [[[a-fitting-end| be]]]  [[[the-death-of-alto-clef-etc| deceased]]]. Other accounts insist that he&#39;s [[[resurrection| still around]]], now working with his [[[gamedaypart1index| former secretary]]], [[[contingency| Andrea Adams]]]. &#34;Alto Clef&#34; is almost certainly [[[classicalrevivalindex| an alias]]], possibly one used by [[[father-of-lies| multiple individuals]]].

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/researcher-conwell| Researcher Jacob Conwell]]]:** Anomalous Materials Analyst. Masters Degree in Analytical Chemistry. [[[All Hallows| Current head]]] of the [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64| Site-64]]] AMat Lab. Frequently called upon, Conwell has made a name for himself in the Foundation as a hard worker.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I&#39;m doing so much these days.&#34; hide=&#34;...&#34;]]

Initially over eager to please Foundation superiors, promotion to primary investigator positions has resulted in [[[Peregrine| multiple depressive episodes]]] and insomnia, though these have improved following Conwell&#39;s transfer to Site-64 and marriage. Routine psychological evaluations are ongoing.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/kain-pathos-crow| Dr. Kain &#34;Pathos&#34; Crow]]]:** [[[olympia| Cross-disciplinary]]] //wunderkind// researcher, specializing particularly in [[[dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic| biochemistry]]] and [[[new-tricks| robotics]]]. Rarely, if ever, seen in public. May or may not have been permanently [[[classicalrevivalindex| transformed]]] into a [[[scp-4444| dog-like body]]] as the result of a particular [[[upswing-of-disorder| anomalous event]]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;I&#39;m so tired these days.&#34; hide=&#34; I don&#39;t even want to work on the walker...&#34;]]

Ran a number of highly classified cross-testing experiments with the aim of creating useful objects of anomalous origin, notably [[[olympia-project| Project Olympia]]]. Nearly terminated several times. Difficulties in the canine body and an [[[rounderhouse-proposal| unclear lifespan]]] have resulted in a considerable drop in productivity. Many of his side projects have become dormant.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-dan| Dr. Dan]]] ███████:** Insufferable, emotive genius with a big-picture-centric set of principles. Former marine. Lead researcher on [[[scp-096 | an SCP]]] too dangerous to keep around, but couldn&#39;t make the O5 Council see it that way. [[[incident-096-1-a | Took matters into his own hands]]], getting dozens of people killed, getting his decommissioning request accepted, and getting a death sentence (in that order).

[[collapsible show=&#34;You make one little mistake...&#34; hide=&#34;...and they give you an entire department.&#34;]]

Still alive a decade later, spent the time drafting decommissioning proposals in detention before a [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub | mass containment breach]]] made his non-linear thinking skills invaluable again. Now serves as [[[the-bowe-decommission-part-one | Director]]] of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA), masterminding the Foundation response to anomalous disasters like the one he famously engineered, ever mindful of the very human toll such cleverness can take on the world at large.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-edison| Dr. Michael Edison]]]:** Level-3 Researcher, current head of the Foundation&#39;s Inter-Site Testing Initiative (ISTI). Dr. Edison has received disciplinary action on multiple occasions due to a repeated pattern of [[[scp-foundation-the-movie | unsanctioned]]] and [[[game-day-1-die-hardest|ill-conceived]]] behavior. These behaviors have resulted in temporary reassignment to the Site-██ Antarctic base. His current assignment at Site 19 is contingent on approval from his assigned therapist.

[[collapsible show=&#34;My legends begins in the 12th century...&#34; hide=&#34;FOOL!&#34;]]

Though quiet and reserved most of the time, Dr. Edison secretly dreams of being a badass like Dr. Clef (or at least the image most staffers have of Dr. Clef). While respected as a researcher, his attempts at more outrageous endeavors are most often met with derision. Has a petty, but long-standing grudge against Delivery Agent Roadrunner. [[[bargain-bin-of-direct-to-forum-sequels| Is known to]]] [[[dr-ikari-i-presume| sometimes write]]] [[[scp-foundation-the-movie-2| terrible fanfiction.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood| Dr. Justine &#39;Jay&#39; Everwood]]]:** GoI specialist, very well-read and knowledgeable on the many groups of interests the Foundation faces. Is particularly interested in [[[dr-wondertainment-hub| Dr. Wondertainment]]] and [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions]]]. Is generally approachable but is often lost in thought, be they [[[robin| mundane]]] or fantastical.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Have a wonderful day!&#34; hide=&#34;...&#34;]]
Prefers to go by Jay rather than Justine, and presents themselves as nonbinary but also accepts female pronouns. They are missing their right arm, which was lost in an unexplained noodle incident. Rex Alces is their trusted assistant, and they are often stationed at Site-55.
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Chelsea &#34;Photosynthetic&#34; Elliott:** Plant specialist, both anomalous and non-anomalous. Dedicated, friendly, prone to tunnel vision. Often in the field; excessively [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| &#39;hands-on&#39;]]] in her lab and field research, leading to a number of injuries. Scars cover her hands and arms.

[[collapsible show=&#34;We&#39;re at the cusp of something here.&#34; hide=&#34;...&#34;]]

Possible [[[light-dependent-reactions| anomalous capability]]] due to exposure to a &#34;[[[scp-2108|sun of unknown provenance]]]&#34;). Investigation is ongoing. Possible security risk due to strong personal desire to advance worldwide scientific knowledge in her chosen field; she&#39;s possibly a little //too// excited about the marvels she has studied, and feel conflicted about [[[rounderhouse-proposal| her role]]] within the Foundation.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-gears| Dr. Charles Gears]]] (&#34;COG&#34;):**  A man [[[epitaph| strangely lacking]]] in [[[termination-log-scp-1016| emotional response]]] (to the point of lacking a startle response) and possessing unusual levels of [[[lullaby| logic and intellect]]]. Former Euclid-class object specialist before having his area of study expanded. Has been deeply involved with research regarding a truly shocking number of SCP objects both major and minor.  A figure of [[[in-his-own-image| great influence]]] in recent Foundation [[[rounderhouse-proposal| history]]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;It is not acceptable to inquire that.&#34; hide=&#34;I do what is required.&#34;]]
Records claim he was recruited shortly after the founding of the Foundation... despite his age and personal history not quite matching up to that timeline. A personal fact that few know: He //does// feel emotion, when it&#39;s significant. He simply does not react to it or show it. Because he cannot. Why? If there is a reason, few know.

Possibly the father of [[[pawn-to-e4| Alison Chao]]], the woman calling herself the [[[black-queen-hub| &#34;Black Queen&#34;]]]. [[[loosen-up-a-bit| Possibly]]] the [[[annon| son]]] of an O5 Council Member.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-glass| Dr. Simon Glass]]]:** Head of Psychology.  Trusted with performing [[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass| psychological evaluations]]] of highly ranked Foundation personnel. Very empathetic. Sometimes considered &#34;soft&#34; -- and that&#39;s true, for a Foundation researcher, but he&#39;s still well-trusted. In the course of [[[oneirocritic| his interviews]]], he has gained knowledge of more and more terrible secrets, yet still holds on to both his sanity and empathy.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I talk to everyone, I know everyone...&#34; hide=&#34;... Of course I&#39;m loyal.&#34;]]
Associates linked to a number of groups of interest, including the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]] (via a relative) and the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub| Serpent&#39;s Hand]]]. Feels self-conscious about how higher-ups view him because of this.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-heiden| Dr. Frederick Heiden]]]:** Neurology specialist. Anxious, uncertain, empathic, focused on logic. Involved in a number of highly classified projects, despite initially being barred from any non-Safe-classed objects.
[[collapsible show=&#34;Shhhhhh.&#34; hide=&#34;...&#34;]]

May be secretly under Dr. Bright&#39;s wing. There are... &#34;plans&#34; for Heiden. Or... were. Perhaps. Heiden may or may not have been killed and brought back to life; he may or may not in fact be dead, though he is listed as active staff and appears to be playing some kind of role within the Foundation regardless.##white|^^1^^##

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-king| Dr. Everett King]]]:** One of the Foundation&#39;s most experienced mathematicians, Doctor King&#39;s reputation has nevertheless been overtaken by his [[[scp-216| testing record]]] involving unusual results. Despite this, he regularly contributes to internal Foundation intellectual periodicals.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I don&#39;t want any more goddamn apples.&#34; hide=&#34;And I&#39;ve never gotten any...&#34;]]

Dr. King&#39;s testing must be heavily supervised, due to the [[[game-day-1-die-hardest| presence of apple seeds]]] that seem to be increasing exponentially in intensity.  Intensive observation indicates [[[long-live-the-king| Dr. King]]] is irritated by his seemingly inherent effect.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/zyn-kiryu| Dr. Zyn Kiryu]]]:** Highly prolific researcher. Involved in a number of [[[lucky dinosaur| classified]]] Foundation projects. Obsessive, driven, often not eating or sleeping in favor of finishing tasks. Finished her schooling through an [[[snakes and ladders | accelerated program]]] after joining the Foundation. Initially closed-off and withdrawn, but opened up due to a latent ambitious streak. She often volunteers to handle new Foundation member intake, hoping to give new members a positive introduction to an often deeply horrifying organization. Has a private flair for poetry. Has accidentally inherited the absent Dr. Kondraki&#39;s affiliation with [[[scp-2332| anomalous butterflies]]], including [[[SCP-408]]] after Kondraki&#39;s disappearance.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for this.&#34; hide=&#34;You know that&#39;s from a game, right?&#34;]]

Has a brother, Mark Kiryu, a higher-ranked researcher. O5 Command has its eye fixed on Zyn Kiryu for unknown reasons, having dismissed her higher-ranked brother as ultimately irrelevant. She is being watched and investigated by the Red Right Hand -- whether positively or negatively is unknown.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/mark-kiryu| Dr. Mark Kiryu]]]:** Senior researcher and director of an anomalous items [[[kiryu labs hub | processing lab]]]. Upon initial recruitment, had a successful career as a therapist (licensed psychologist). Worked extensively with [[[SCP-1457]]] in his first years with the Foundation but doesn&#39;t talk about that, and has spearheaded several projects involving sapient SCP entities. Cheery attitude and a good listener; looks out for his coworkers and interns like a bit of a mother hen sometimes. Has a ceramic seahorse and potted bamboo on his desk.

----

**Dr. Adam Leeward:** [[[baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi|Emotionally confused]]] and [[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love| ethically conflicted]]] humanoid containment specialist from Site-11 and living in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81| Site-81]]]. May or may not have made a few mistakes, may or may not have cleaned up a few mistakes. Not without the standard degree of coldness in personality traits, but with a few (sometimes painful) soft spots.

[[collapsible show=&#34;There&#39;s something off about you, Lee.&#34; hide=&#34;- Of course, there always was.&#34;]]

Under watch for abnormal behavior. Well-intentioned, but not without flaws. Of course, in this field, flaws like these can get you in deeper than you ever [[[scp-2708|expected.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-light| Dr. Sophia Light]]]:** Biologist, surgeon and Site Director with  far, far too many secrets. A likeable yet frightening person. Blunt, determined, calculating; good under pressure. Putting effort into remaining friendly and open (and emotionally stable). Bears minor facial scarring, and an old injury in her left hand sometimes impairs its functionality. Somewhat traumatic childhood; caretakers forced her to learn outdoor survival by leaving her stranded in the African wilderness for days on end. Joined the Foundation after a classified anomalous incident that killed eleven people, including her then-fiancee. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Troy Lament.

[[collapsible show=&#34;It&#39;s not my fault they want another meeting.&#34; hide=&#34;...&#34;]]

The rumors that persist of Dr. Light&#39;s [[[deals-with-the-devil| strangely close involvement]]] with O5 Command (especially O5-2) are accurate, although that doesn&#39;t mean they make life easy for her - she&#39;s [[[resurrection| currently]]] head of the (possibly doomed) anomalous Task Force [[[task-forces#alpha-9| Alpha-9]]]. Seems to have been [[[annon| involved in]]] a number of [[[recovered-data-file| highly classified]]] reality shifts -- including some [[[yesterday| initiated by]]] the Foundation itself. A centrally important figure to the Foundation for a number of extremely secret reasons, some of which she doesn&#39;t know (or does not still remember) herself.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/researcher-lloyd| Dr. Samuel M. Lloyd]]]:**  English [[[the-world-forgetting-by-the-world-forgot| memeticist]]] and part-time Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison Supervisor who shows up [[[scp-2668| all over the place]]]. Likes to keep tabs on whatever&#39;s going on, and likes interacting with anomalies [[[error-field-cannot-be-lloyd| more than]]] is good for him. Cynical, self-centred and in over his head, but generally well-meaning. Younger than you&#39;d expect.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Just remember...&#34; hide=&#34;I never asked for this.&#34;]]

[[[scp-3856| Affected by an anomaly]]] that causes him to die last. Word on the street is that something may be keeping him safe.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-mann| Dr. Everett Mann]]]:** [[[the-hatbot-chronicles| Unconventional]]] medical researcher with few scruples and a specialty in unusual forms of surgery. Jokingly referred to as a &#34;mad scientist&#34;. (He objects to the term &#34;mad scientist&#34;, claiming that &#34;mad doctor&#34; would be more accurate, and further that the difference should be plain to anyone with a proper academic background to speak of.) Willing to do [[[the-gate-opens| monstrous things]]] in the name of research. Possesses a dramatic moustache. Due to his [[[scp-6999| upbringing]]],  his cultural and popular knowledges are [[[Be a Dali and Help a Mann Out, or The Lamentable State of Modern Art| woefully out of date]]], leading to anachronistic and ridiculous situations.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Yes, I wanted to show you what I&#39;ve been working on.&#34; hide=&#34;It&#39;s dreadfully fascinating.&#34;]]

Came to Foundation attention via the uncle who raised him, a person of interest to the Foundation due to anomalous research. In close contact with [[[conviction| some]]] of the [[[scp-001-o5| most]]] senior [[[rounderhouse-proposal| people]]] in the Foundation. Considered a potential danger to the Foundation under [[[ecceperago| certain]]] predicted future [[[scp-5555| circumstances]]].

**Dr. Connor MacWarren:** Active researcher focusing on the development of anomalous technologies on top of being one of the board of directors at [[[a-working-theory|Site-98]]] in Philadelphia. [[[SCP-4366|Currently oversees his own department]]] specializing in [[[SCP-5800|extradimensional anomalies]]].

**The Man With The Upside-Down Face &amp; Icky the Magic Clown:** Believed to be the [[[Dread &amp; Circuses hub | current leaders]]] of [[[herman-fuller-hub | Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting]]]. Icky serves as the Ringmaster, whereas the Man With The Upside-Down Face works behind the scenes.

[[[icky-the-magic-clown| Icky the Magic Clown]]] is believed to be one of many ontokinetic humanoids employed as Clowns by the Circus, though investigations have led the Foundation to believe she was originally a [[[herman-fuller-can-shove-it-up-his-ass| non-anomalous girl]]] named Veronica Mason. She is often accompanied by her stage assistant and [[[city-of-wonder| lover]]], [[[former-assets| Li&#39;l Lollipop]]], another ontokinetic humanoid. Lollipop&#39;s affiliation with the Ringmaster appears to have granted her a [[[SCP-3329| privileged status]]] in the Circus as well.

To date, the Foundation has been unable to confirm any information regarding The Man With The Upside-Down Face, including whether or not his face is actually [[[opening-night| upside-down]]]. He is rumoured to be the [[[former-assets| leader]]] and [[[family-ties| protector]]] of the Circus&#39;s [[[free-freaks| &#34;Freaks&#34;]]], and to play an  [[[scp-2094| important]]] [[[a-scip-or-a-star| role]]] in their [[[freaky-commodities| recruitment]]].

Likely a high level Reality Bender as well as a skilled fleshcrafter, biologically immortal due to anomalous physical alterations. According to Sarkic legend, Ion was born 4000 years ago in the region now known as Siberia, and led a slave rebellion against the [[[SCP-140| Daevites]]]. Assuming that &#34;Grand Karcist Ion&#34; was an actual historical figure rather than an inherited title or a [[[the-parables-of-pseudo-nadox| mythological character]]], he is credited with founding an empire and ruled for at least [[[scp-2095| 1000 years]]]. Presumed deceased, possibly during an [[[sic-semper-tyrannis| ancient conflict]]] with the [[[so-the-beasts-shall-plague-the-land-no-more| Mekhanites]]] (a predecessor to the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub| Church of the Broken God]]]), and therefore only of historical interest.

**Mr. Marshall, Mr. Carter, and [[[poi-dark| Mr. ]]] / [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/iris-dark| Ms. Dark]]]:** The [[[acquisitions1| leaders]]] and [[[from-vagrants-to-gentlemen| founders]]] of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter and Dark]]], an organization selling anomalous items to the rich and powerful. Information on their upper management is limited and often inconsistent, possibly because [[[third-death| several generations]]] of the same families are involved.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The esteemed Misters Marshall, Carter...&#34; hide=&#34;... and Dark.&#34;]]

[[[acquisitions2| Reports]]] on Marshall and Carter have been wildly inconsistent. A [[[mc-d-agent-orientation| number of reports]]] characterize Carter as wheelchair-bound, presenting Marshall as younger; these reports are contradicted by [[[acquisitions3| other sources]]] saying exactly the opposite. Reports on Carter that claim he is wheelchair-bound also claim he is using anomalous life extension, apparently feeding off a bagged and drugged (but still aware) human attached to the back of his wheelchair. Additional [[[third-death| rumors]]] assert that &#34;Amos&#34; Marshal feeds on human souls, while &#34;Ruprect&#34; Carter is able to transfer his consciousness between bodies.

The appearance and nature of [[[poi-dark| Dark]]] is even more speculative, but reports on Dark (alternatively spelled [[[a-darke-tale-new-age|Darke]]]) fall into three categories. The first category presents Dark as being a role filled by multiple people (of all genders, but possibly originally and currently male) over the last few centuries. The second category presents Dark as a single semi-immortal sapient entity, humanoid in nature if not always in form, possibly able to change bodies and gender to suit current purposes. A third category presents [[[so they called him darke| both as true]]], with a much older &#34;Percival&#34; Darke coexisting with a younger &#34;proxy&#34; (perhaps the [[[dark-and-disquieting| latest]]] of [[[the-boy-who-cried-wolf| many]]]).

It seems that Marshall and Carter do not fully understand Dark either. While they handle most operations, Dark has more control over MC&amp;D than they do, and [[[a-question-of-commerce| predates]]] Marshall and Carter [[[scp-3549| significantly]]]. Curiously, it seems that Dark may be less malevolent than MC&amp;D itself — whoever they are, their morality seems highly situational, though they are capable of [[[scp-5802| monstrous acts]]] above and beyond the capabilities of their organization.

[[[wills-and-ways-hub| Some]]] [[[all-that-glisters| accounts]]] of MC&amp;D describe &#34;Junior Partners&#34;, descendants of the &#34;Senior Partners&#34; described above. These include adventurer and explorer [[[skitter-marshall| Skitter Marshal]]], hedonistic playboy [[[robert-carter| Robert Carter]]], and technological prodigy [[[iris-dark| Iris Dark]]], [[[micky-d-s|Chief]]] of [[[the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6| Paratech]]] [[[mcd-smart-hex| Development]]] and [[[osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1| Acquisition]]] at MC&amp;D.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I dare say, there must be more to it than that!&#34; hide=&#34;....&#34;]]

[[[lord-blackwood-astro-naut| Though]]] his  [[[lord-blackwood-and-the-thaumaturge-the-t| exploits]]] are [[[from-the-diaries-of-lord-blackwood| almost ]]] certainly [[[lord-blackwood-and-the-land-of-the-unclean| false]]] and do not match [[[lord-blackwood-and-the-great-tarasque-hunt-of-83| recorded history]]], they have been  [[[a-most-unfortunate-reunion| corroborated]]] to some extent by a startling number of [[[uncle-teddy| sources]]]. Some accounts indicate his adventuring society may have had ties to the [[[When One Reaches The End| post-War Foundation]]].

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/cain| &#34;Cain&#34;]]]:** Anomalous humanoid, contained as [[[SCP-073]]]. Amiable and calm, generally helpful towards Foundation staff, though prefers to keep some aspects of his past hidden.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I am glad to help you.&#34; hide=&#34;If only I could make amends&#34;]]

Brother to [[[SCP-076| SCP-076-2]]], &#34;Able&#34;. If he truly is the [[[djoric-dmatix-proposal| biblical Cain]]], then he was cursed by God to wander the Earth forever as punishment for [[[beneath-two-trees| murdering]]] his brother, although Able didn&#39;t stay dead. [[[SCP-6666|Allegedly]]] feels remorse for the loss of his family. If you don&#39;t believe the Bible story, he&#39;s been described as everything from the son of an [[[project-paragon-hub| ancient king]]] to a [[[the-reassembled-one| Prophet]]] of the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub| Broken God]]]. Despite history with Able, Cain [[[In Harm&#39;s Way| agreed]]] to sign on to MTF [[[task-forces#alpha-9|Alpha-9]]], the [[[resurrection| resurrected]]] MTF [[[task-forces#omega-7| Omega-7]]].

**[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/donkman#pages| Ulysses B. Donkman]]]:** Designated [[[SCP-4768]]] by the Foundation, is a humanoid male bearing the head of a donkey. Despite unusual appearance, is capable of altering perception of itself and its surroundings, both for thematic and for stealth purposes. Substantially old, known to have been active since the early 19th century. [[[the-donkman-s-den|Lauded]]] for his strength, skill and chivalry. Participant in many [[[Ulysses B. Donkman and the Clockwork Bandits|bold adventures]]] and [[[Ulysses B. Donkman and the Heinous Hitman| daring escapes]]], often considered to be more legend than fact.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I hear some of y&#39;all like to call me half-assed.&#34; hide=&#34;But I&#39;ll always be more of a man than you.&#34;]]

His many heroic acts have spawned more than a few enemies, and his long lifespan has left him with his fair share of demons. [[[SCP-5307|Many people or groups]]]  have spent generations trying to hunt him down, whether for vengeance or for profit. Continues pursuing danger and heroism, in spite of his seeming lone nature; it is unknown if he has any [[[Ulysses B. Donkman and the Mournful Birthday| associates or relatives]]], or what his true motivations are.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/hard-to-kill-reptile| &#34;The Hard-To-Destroy Reptile&#34;]]]:** Contained as [[[SCP-682]]], a seemingly indestructible and highly adaptive reptile-like creature that the Foundation [[[experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682| just can&#39;t kill]]]. Driven by omnicidal rage, its containment breaches have cost the Foundation an uncountable amount of resources and personnel.

The Reptile&#39;s imprisonment by the Foundation has brought it into contact with multiple other SCP objects, including [[[the-warrior-and-the-dragon| SCP-076 &#34;Able&#34;]]], [[[scp-079| SCP-079 &#34;Old AI&#34;]]], and [[[scp-999| SCP-999 &#34;The Tickle Monster&#34;]]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;You are... &#34; hide=&#34;Disgusting...&#34;]]
Theories on The Reptile&#39;s origin range from it being an [[[summer-s-exile| exile from another world]]] to the offspring of the Scarlet King&#39;s [[[new-job| Fourth Bride]]]. Variants of 682 in alternate worlds have been observed as being [[[scp-2935|dead]]], @@[@@[[[scp-6820| DATA EXPUNGED]]]@@]@@, and [[[the-worst-version-of-myself| in one case]]], the mutated form of Foundation Researcher Dr. Charles Gears.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Seems like the story&#39;s over...&#34; hide=&#34;Hope&#39;s the only thing left in the box.&#34;]]

[[[immediate-actions | After an incursion]]] by unknown assailants, it seems like the Foundation may [[[resurrection | once again]]] be interested in utilising her. Iris is now a [[[the-wolves-at-the-door| reluctant recruit]]] to Mobile Task Force [[[task-forces#alpha-9|Alpha-9]]] (&#34;Last Hope&#34;), since she knows from bitter experience that the whole thing could go horribly wrong at any minute.

[[tab Former Personnel]]

= //In retirement or death, no rank distinction is made.//

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/general-bowe| General Bowe]]]:** More than anyone, the man who represents the old sins of the Foundation. Promoted after the death of his father, General Stan Bowe, due to the effects of [[[SCP-935]]]. As his father&#39;s protege, he was assigned as the head of the Bowe Commission, which began for murky still-classified reasons and expanded in scope under the younger Bowe, ending with a nearly sole focus on weaponizing SCP objects before its dissolution. Has since left the Foundation.

[[collapsible show=&#34;ACCesDend&#34; hide=&#34;dsdffdsfvd&#34;]]
Under the younger Bowe, the Bowe Commission shifted the Foundation&#39;s paramilitary focus from defense to offense. The Bowe Commission was responsible for the creation of &#34;Project Able&#34; and Mobile Task Force [[[task-forces#omega-7| Omega-7]]] (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;), given permission for the project after a number of successful operations against several dangerous groups of interest. Bowe was personally responsible for much of the worst excesses of the project; he allowed [[[SCP-076| SCP-076-2]]] to take a leadership role and have say in which SCP items were allowed to join, and he personally ordered the project to continue after an incident in which 076-2 killed a number of researchers. When 076-2 disabled its restraints and slaughtered most of the other Mobile Task Force members and caused the destruction of Containment Area-25, Bowe was assigned primary blame. MTF Omega-7 was dissolved, as was the Bowe Commission. As a result of this, and the [[[SCP-935]]] incidents, Much of the Foundation&#39;s paramilitary arm was censured or defected after this, and many of the Bowe Commission&#39;s supporters defected to the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]] or the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]].

Bowe was presumed deceased, but [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub| more recent evidence]]] suggests that he&#39;s still alive, and isn&#39;t finished with the Foundation yet.

Extremely controversial figure who vanished from the Foundation some time ago. Ambitious, artistic, chaotic, paranoid, anti-social, spiteful; seen by many as an [[[duke-till-dawn| archetypal anti-hero]]]. Known to run roughshod over others; reprimanded for abuse of lower-ranked or newer Foundation employees. Had a flair for the [[[termination-order| dramatic]]], regardless of [[[siabhub| consequences]]]. An excellent photographer. Formerly associated with [[[SCP-408]]], to a possibly inappropriate degree. Grew rivals on trees; [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki| most famously]]] Dr. Alto Clef.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/researcher-lloyd| Dr. Darryl Loyd]]]:** A supposed former researcher that was at some point attached to the Foundation. There are conflicting documents as to what position he worked in, and to date paperwork has been found that associates him with the Memetics Department and the Anomalous Items office, as well as the [[[scp-4002| Department of Para-Archaeology]]].

Supposedly he has died, but this information is conflicting as well. His remains were found at Site-███ following the [[[SCP-1504| activation of its onsite nuclear device]]]. But he was also confirmed to have been executed due to his role in [[[SCP-3002|starting an MK-Class Scenario]]]. Additionally, the body of a researcher from early in the Foundation&#39;s history shares the name and DNA of modern records of Loyd. Little else is currently known about this figure.

Extremely loyal to The Foundation, his family and his former [[[portraits-of-your-father| boyfriend]]], [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/draven-kondraki| Draven Kondraki]]]. A will of steel. He died in [[[SCP-3999| mysterious circumstances]]] preventing a containment breach, the details of which are a mystery throughout the Foundation.

[[collapsible show=&#34;I am sick of your horror!&#34; hide=&#34;I am sick of you.&#34;]]

There are conflicting theories as to the nature, and eventual fate of Talloran. The official record is they died. Some say they  made it back [[[i-stared-into-the-face-of-everything-and-nothing|alive]]] but were [[[the-trouble-with-amnestics| changed]]], some say they [[[like-clockwork-hub| broke through somewhere]]] after facing a god. We are even still uncertain if Talloran is James Martin or [[[let-us-get-murdered| Jessie Ari]]]. They are a blur, a toughness unmatched by even the best of us, an enigma and a fighter. They cannot and will always die in the dark, surrounded by light.

[[tab O5 Command and The Administrator]]

**O5 Command:** 13 people who have ultimate control over the Foundation. Unusual personalities with way too much power. They do not and cannot come into contact with any anomalous entities. Mostly everyone is afraid of them. They know absolutely everything there is to know about the Foundation and its activities. They rarely intervene in the containment of SCPs... except when they do. They have their own Mobile Task Force, [[[task-forces#alpha-1| Alpha-1]]], the &#34;Red Right Hand&#34;. O5 Command are the masters of the Foundation, and not everyone knows they exist.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Nothing is certain.&#34; hide=&#34;Especially not us. God no.&#34;]]

... //Maybe.// Maybe there are 13, maybe they are people. They&#39;re not //supposed// to come into contact with anomalous entities, but in secret, sometimes they do. Who are they? Where did they come from? What secret goals are they striving towards? Either way, O5 Command is the cornerstone of the Foundation. At the very least, they have the Foundation&#39;s best interests at heart... Maybe.

**&#34;[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/the-administrator| The Administrator]]]&#34;:** Figure of little-known nature playing a role best understood by O5 Command. Possibly anomalous, possibly multiple people. Once represented the Foundation in meetings with major world government figures; has since relinquished this role. Possibly retired, possibly deceased.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Why?&#34; hide=&#34;Maybe you&#39;re asking the wrong questions.&#34;]]

It&#39;s an open secret amongst the upper echelons of the Foundation that  &#34;The Administrator&#34; (as popularly known) never at any point existed, but was a clever fiction created by another person or persons (or... something else) within the Foundation for the purposes of unifying of a fractious organization. As for what should be made of that, no one agrees.

Object: SCP-6105
Object Class: Euclid

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-6105-A and SCP-6105-B are to be contained in a three (3) room cell furnished with basic furniture and items, as well as a bathroom. Subjects are not allowed out of their cell at any time for any reason.
So far these three points keep the subjects in their cell
*SCP-6105-A and SCP-6105-B do not seem to want to be separated from each other. 
*SCP-6105-B seems to follow SCP-6105-A&#39;s lead, never doing anything without her say-so
*SCP-6105-A never leaves the darker part of the rooms its is in. Otherwise it doesn&#39;t move. 

**Description:** Both subjects have the same facial features, brown hair, a weight of 25 kg (55 lbs), and a height of 0.76. The difference between the two is almost impossible to notice from a distance, but its obvious when you see them up close. 
SCP-6105-A has black eyes that cause any room its in to become dim, no matter how brightly lit the room is. It also has black tattoos on its upper arms that resemble wings. 
SCP-6105-B has white eyes that seem to enhance the lights of any room the subject is in. Sometimes this can cause rooms to become so bright that they can temporarily blind anyone inside. Subject has similar tattoos as SCP-6105-A, only grey instead of black. 

SCP-6105-A is referred to as “Bro” by SCP-6105-B. It’s anomalous ability is unknown at the time of the writing of this file, as the subject was always trying to remain in the darkest parts of any room it was in and refrain from contact with any personnel. 

SCP-6105-B, which is referred to as “Sis” by SCP-6105-A, showed its anomalous abilities almost as soon as it awoke from the sedatives used to transport it to the site. The first thing it did was summon two blades of pure light which it used to destroy the door of the cell. However, SCP-6105-A refused to move, which seemed to deter SCP-6105-B from leaving. 
SCP-6105-B’s second anomalous ability is using light to vanish from thin air, effectively turning invisible. As with when the subject destroyed the door. SCP-6105-B seemed unable to leave SCP-6105-A behind. 

After a few days in containment, SCP-6105-B ceased to escape containment, while SCP-6105-A began to walk around a little. Eventually the subjects were relocated to a more comfortable cell with separate bedrooms and a bathroom, as well as basic furniture. Upon their relocation, the subject became more docile. 

**Notes:** SCP-6105-A appears to represent the still, calm darkness of the world, while SCP-6105-B represents the ever-present and chaotic light. Not much is known about these entities, as they are a more recent acquisition and haven’t been subjected to any experiments as of yet. 

**Appendix 6105-1**
**Record of Dr. [REDACTED]’s interview with SCP-6105-A before the “Ying-Yang” incident**
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; hello there. 
&lt;SCP-6105-A remains silent&gt;
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; Look, as I told your sister, I don&#39;t mean you two any harm. I only wish to talk. 
&lt;SCP-6105-A still remains silent&gt;
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED] sighs&gt;
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; what do you call yourself?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; I am brother. But Sis calls me Bro.
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; Very good. May I ask what made you answer me?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; I only speak when I deem it necessary. And since you only came to ask questions I feel obliged to keep you from wasting your time. 
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; so you’ll answer all of my questions?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; Only the ones I want to. 
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; Understood. Where are you two from?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; We don&#39;t remember. We just know our task. 
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; What is that?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; we go to churches with events going on, such as sermons, funerals or marriages. We give blessings to the ones suffering the most and punish the ones who hurt the most. The blessings and punishments are not our choosing. We are simply messengers. 
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; what is keeping you from doing so now?
&lt;SCP-6105-A&gt; My question to you is this. 
Why did you insist on hurting that boy?
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED]&gt; what?
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED] suddenly steps back, clutching his chest.&gt;
&lt;SCP-6105-A disappears from sight&gt;
&lt;Dr. [REDACTED] drops to the ground, shaking violently for a few seconds before going still&gt; 

**Addendum 6105-1:**
SCP-6105-A disappeared after delivering what appeared to be fatal words to Dr. [REDACTED], causing mass panic in the complex. SCP-6105-B remained in containment as teams were established to track down SCP-6105-A. In the next five hours, the incident known as the Ying-Yang incident occurred. 
First, numerous SCP’s escaped containment, and although they were mostly harmless Euclid class SPCs, they stretched Site-[REDACTED]’s resources thin. Second, SCP-6105-B left its own containment cell and began a killing spree, slashing the throats of numerous guards randomly. This specific event was reviewed constantly, as it appeared SCP-6105-B spared many of the guards who were trying to defend high-profile personnel, but never any D-Class personnel. Third, the power grid of Site-[REDACTED] failed, and some sectors’ emergency power failed as well, namely [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 |SCP-682]]]’s. Finally, SCP-6105-A returned, appearing near SCP-682. With a single word that was not heard by any staff or audio recorder, SCP-682 fell asleep. At the same moment, the power grid was restored and the chaos ended.

The event taught us that even though SCP-6105 seem complacent with remaining in containment, both are capable of easily breaching containment. Their Object Class has been increased to Keter, and they are not to come into verbal or visual contact with any personnel for any reason, other than Personnel with Level-3 clearance and any D-Class personnel that are to be used for testing.</textarea></pre>

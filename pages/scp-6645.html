**SCP-6645:** Santa Brick &amp; Dr. Brown
**Author:** ESB2109
**Content Warning!:** N/A
**Writer&#39;s Notes:** Hi! ESB Here. You may notice this Article doesn&#39;t include much of the SCP itself, but rather it&#39;s main victim, Brown. I felt there aren&#39;t enough articles like this so I had decided to write one myself. I&#39;m still honestly quite new to Article-Writing, so please please let me know how to improve the article. Hope you enjoy!

**Special Containment Procedures:**#
As of 03/03/2021, The Department of Human Rights have full right to change Containment Procedures, without Site Director, O5 Council, or Ethics Committee Permission.
SCP-6645-A and SCP-6645-B are to be contained at Power-Site-106 at all times. STF-Alpha-24 &#34;Carbon Corps&#34; are stationed at Power-Site-106.

 --SCP-6654-A is to be contained in a 1x1x1m Polycarbonate Container. SCP-6645-A is not to be touched, including through cloth. If entering the cell of SCP-6645-A, nitrile gloves must be worn.-- SCP-6645-A has been terminated. 

SCP-6645-B subjects are to be contained within a cell that resembles a human house. To prevent any decay, multiple layers of walls must be used. SCP-6645-B Variants are to not be touched, including through worn items. Subjects must stay unclothed, as attempts to clothe SCP-6645-B instances just results in the clothes instantly breaking into coal. Any subject that touches SCP-6645-B will be terminated immediately. As of 05/22/2022, The Ethics Committee has banned the creation of more SCP-6645-B subjects. Assuming more SCP-6645-B variations is created, they must be terminated humanely and quickly. 

When a living subject makes physical contact with SCP-6645-A, the subject must be classified SCP-6645-B.

The only living SCP-6645-B Instance, Dr. Brown, is permitted to be used to fuel the Coal Power Plant, Power-Site-106, as part of the Integration Program. Dr. Brown is not allowed to be directly spoken to, only through microphones. Overseeing of Dr. Brown is fulfilled by staff at the Department of Human Resources, as Dr. Brown is still considered an employee of the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-6645-A is a interlocking brick toy created by the LEGO Group, which resembles Social Phenomena “Santa Claus”, on a Sleigh. The left ski of SCP-6645-A is noted to be missing. 
SCP-6645-A has some form of intelligence and the anomalous trait to make any subject who makes contact with it to have what some have called “Coal Touch” [[footnote]] Anything a Subject Touches turns to Carbon. [[/footnote]]

SCP-6645-B Instances are those of which have touched SCP-6645-A. These subjects cannot touch any object but Coal. Assuming they touch an object which is not Coal, the object will totally become carbon, specifically Anthracite. Dr. Brown has coined the term “Hyper-carbonisation”[[footnote]] Hypercarbonate: To Instantly turn any object they touch straight into Carbon, namely Coal [[/footnote]] to define the process.
Only one living SCP-6645-B Instance - Dr. Brown is known to exist, as of 09/15/2022. 

Dr. Brown, former Senior Researcher, now SCP-6645-B instance, is a Caucasian British Male at age 27. He is to be referred to with He/Him Pronouns as opposed to standard procedure, of It/It’s. He has been contained for 7 years. Dr. Brown has Psychosis, but this is not considered anomalous.

**STF-Alpha-24:**
Stationary Task Force Alpha-24, colloquially known as the “Carbon Corps”, is permanently Stationed at Power-Site-106, and always supervising SCP-6645. The Task Force originally operated to keep containment of SCP-6645-A, but since the termination of it, the task force has changed roles. STF-Alpha-24 continues to provide wellness services for Dr. Brown, and operate Power-Site-106. 

**Power-Site-106:**
Site-106 was built in 1998 as an Administration Site which held no Anomalies or Dangerous items. Due to the Site&#39;s proximity to Dr. Brown&#39;s home, and first sighting of SCP-6645-A, on the Isle of Portland, England, the site had containment facilities established. Since 2017, Site-106 has housed SCP-6645-A and B. In 2020, Site-106 was renovated as a Coal Power Plant.

**Dr. Brown- SCP-6645-B:**
Dr. Brown is the only surviving SCP-6645-B instance since the Site-106 Fire. Dr. Brown cannot touch any surface, except coal; He has the standard anomalous state of other SCP-6645-B instances. Staff are not to be alarmed of Dr. Brown’s lack of clothes.

**Consciousness in SCP-6645-A:**
SCP-6645-A is believed to have consciousness, although this is yet to be confirmed. On 01/04/2020, SCP-6645-A had escaped containment by hitting into the glass of the container. It then purposefully aimed to attack and inflict damage onto employees attempting to recontain it, making supervisors and researchers believe it does indeed have a consciousness. The item has rarely moved since being replaced in Polycarbonate, for reasons which are yet to be known.

**Discovery:**
SCP-6645-A was discovered on 12/25/2017 in the Home of Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown had found the anomaly while looking through a container of personal items from the Researcher’s Youth. Reportedly when Dr. Brown opened the box, SCP-6645-A flew into Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown then gained the colloquial “Coal Touch”. As a result, Foundation staff transported SCP-6645-A and SCP-6645-B to Site-106. Originally, the anomalies were planned to be transported to Site-███, however transportation proved futile.

The origins of SCP-6645-A, however, are not known.


**Addendum.6645.1:**
SCP-6645-A was classed as Safe, and not believed to be able to escape a Simple glass box. However, on 01/04/2020, SCP-6645-A breached the glass of the Box by repeatedly hitting into the glass, and therefore forcing the glass to break.SCP-6645 flew around the room &amp; attempted to touch any staff members in the proximity. STF-Alpha-24 reported to the breach and attempted to Neutralise SCP-6645-A. Although the neutralisation attempt had been unsuccessful, SCP-6645-A was recontained, into a Polycarbonate box. Two STF team members, Agent Jacobs &amp; Agent March, had been in contact with SCP-6645-A, therefore gaining anomalous abilities. They were contained with Dr. Brown.

**Addendum.6645.2:**
In late 2020, Site-106 had been upgraded to house a Coal Power Plant. SCP-6645-B instances were assigned into the Integration Program. They occasionally receive waste delivered to them by Staff at the facility, and are asked to touch the waste, turning it to coal. Site-106 was Reassigned to Power-Site-106. It was noted that Dr. Brown was displeased by the usage of himself &amp; his peers for power production, but continued to begrudgingly cooperate.
Staff at Power-Site-106 were not permitted to use SCP-6645-A to create new SCP-6645-B instances, as per demands by the Ethics Committee.

**Addendum.6645.3:**
On 05/02/2021, Power-Site-106 had a fire. Two SCP-6645-B instances were terminated as a result of the fire. Dr. Brown survived, but suffered burns, of which he is still recovering.
SCP-6645-A was terminated also in the fire. This reduced all risk of more SCP-6645-B instances. STF-Alpha-24’s objective changed from Containment to solely Power-Plant work and Research into Dr. Brown.

**Addendum.6645.4:**
Psychological Appointments with Dr. Brown are to now be regularly held due to the fire that killed his two Fellow Agents. Below is the first appointment Transcription.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]&#34; hide=&#34;[PERMISSION GRANTED]&#34;]]

&gt; **[Recording Begins]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Psychologist:** “Hello, Dr. Brown. It’s an honour to meet you today. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?”
&gt; **Brown:** “For fucks sake... sure, fine.”
&gt; **Psychologist:** “How are you feeling today?”
&gt; **Brown:** “Fan-Fucking-Tastic. I’ve been stuck in this same room for years now. Stuck in my old workplace. The only people I’ve gotten to know in years died last week. I can’t even bloody touch anything, or wear clothes, haven’t even had human contact... Just coal. ALL COAL... **[deep breath]** Couldn’t be better. 
&gt; **Psychologist:** “I see.. how do you feel that you lost Agent Jacobs &amp; Agent March Recently?”
&gt; **Brown:** “Well, does it fucking matter? You’re not doing this to help me, you’re doing it for research. I’ve been in your boots, before I became just another SCP, and so many researchers don’t give two fucks about their subjects.”
&gt; **Psychologist:** “Well... I am here to help. Okay? I’m sure I’ll be back..”
&gt; 
&gt; **[Recording Ends]**

[[/collapsible]]

Since this interview, Dr. Brown has began to get more aggressive verbally. The Foundation is still unaware if this is a side effect of SCP-6645-A.

**Addendum.6645.5:**
After 7 years of containment, Dr Brown has believed to have gone insane. During a routine Psychological appointment, Brown purposefully touched the psychologist, causing her to be Hyper-carbonised, killing her. Since then, psychological appointments have been held from a distance, via speakers.
*Note: Brown’s microphone cannot be reachable by Dr. Brown from now on, or he will hyper-carbonise it.*

**Addendum.6645.6:**
Dr. Brown had began to get further more aggressive. Dr. Brown’s Madness has led him to begin revealing information on Anomalies he had once worked on, of which his Supervisors were not aware of. Supervisory staff of Dr. Brown have become disturbed by Dr. Brown&#39;s highly in-detail descriptions of multiple other Procedures &amp; Anomalies. Staff have been offered amnestics. Dr. Brown has been unable to be given amnestics, as any attempts to provide him amnestics result in him attempting to Hyper-Carbonise the researchers.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]&#34; hide=&#34;[PERMISSION GRANTED]&#34;]]
Site Manager Guercio has been in contact recently with the O5 Council. Both Parties have agreed Dr. Brown may need to be terminated. He has caused trauma and deaths to his colleagues and supervisors. A termination is yet to occur, however.

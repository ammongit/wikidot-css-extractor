+ **SCP Foundation Secure Facility Dossier**
++ Site-17A
**Official Designation:** SCP Foundation Department of Oral Hygiene Dental Office and Research Facility

**Site Identification Code:** USMABO-Site-17-A

**Director:** Dr. Bob Morris

------

++ General Information
[[/=]]

**Purpose:** Site-17A serves primarily as the main facility of the Department of Oral Hygiene, and acts primarily as a dentist’s office for humanoid SCPs. Site-17A serves a secondary purpose to advance the knowledge of anomalous dentistry by studying teeth-related anomalies and the teeth of anomalous objects, primarily humanoids.

**Founded:** 2 February 1992

**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts, near Site-17

**Cover Story:** See Site-17 Dossier

**Size:** Surface Area of 180 m^^2^^

&gt; &#34;Think of it like this: who do you call when Godzilla has a cavity? Or an anomalous object with five rows of teeth needs seven of its teeth pulled? The Medical Division? You’d do best to not bring them up if you value your job, son! If your tooth hurts, do you go to a doctor, or a dentist? You go to a dentist! That’s why we need a separate department! Any and all rumors you’ve heard about paperwork errors creating our department are and always have been false. Probably the Medical Division’s work.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; - Dr. Bob Morris, Director of the Department of Oral Hygiene

[[=]]
++ Additional Information
[[/=]]
Dentistry for anomalous humanoids was handled by Foundation medical staff until 1985, when Dr. Bob Morris was brought in to handle dental and orthodontic care. After extensive lobbying from Dr. Morris, and a rise in notable tooth-related anomalies, the Department of Oral Hygiene was created for more widespread dental care and study.

Dentists will travel to Sites to perform basic dental check-ups. However, should a more involved procedure be required, and following approval from the containment site&#39;s Director and the Site-17A director, humanoids are permitted to travel to Site-17A.

Although the Department Head may receive Level 1 access to patients, non-research staff are on a need-to-know basis, and information about anomalous qualities should only be given if it is deemed necessary to dental examinations or procedures.

There has never been anyone named [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5648 Dr. Rockefeller] working at this site. Personnel should contact security if they meet anyone using this name.

&gt; &#34;Sometimes, I think: Was this worth it? Did I really need to spend years getting my degree just to study some teeth in an attic? Then I make teeth grow on a jackass&#39;s face and I think, yes, yes it was worth it.&#34;
&gt;

+++ First Floor - Dental Clinic
[[/=]]
The first floor of Site-17A is unusual in its design compared to other facilities. At the request of the Department Head, the floor is designed to mimic that of a civilian dental clinic. Areas of Note Include:
* **Greeting Lobby:** Visitors and staff are required to check in with desk secretary before entering or leaving.
* **Dental Examination Rooms:** Designed similarly to civilian examination rooms. Most examinations are performed off-site, though more involved procedures are performed in-house.
* **Offices:** Office space for Orthodontic Accommodations, requests dental care items for humanoid anomalies and dental equipment for staff.

&gt; &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s right. I work for supernatural containment specialists, and my job is still the most boring on the face of the planet.&#34;

Testing and low-risk containment of anomalous dental objects is done on-site, while high-risk samples are held on Site 17. Dental records of anomalous objects and humanoids are also held here for study. An abridged list of notable samples is provided below.

Tooth samples cannot be held for more than two weeks, as the subject&#39;s anomalous qualities affect separated parts. Use of other SCPs to replace removed teeth is frequent.[[/cell]]

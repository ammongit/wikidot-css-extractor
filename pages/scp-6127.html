**Item #:** SCP-6127

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Until such a time that Foundation assets are able to correctly identify the origin of BSP001-42A, the seventeen cows of Spire Farms are to be fed venomous snakes on September 23^^rd^^, 2035. This is done in order to prevent further destabilization of the Primary Timeline. Efforts to prevent any negative effects that arise from failing to locate BSP001-42A are currently the top priority for the Precognition Division.

Katalina Bold has been detained until her interrogation can proceed without pre-emptively resetting the loop. In the event that BSP001-42A successfully concludes, all dairy products originating from Spire Farms are to be recalled and destroyed.

**Description:** SCP-6127 is the death of Director Calibri Bold, set to occur on September 25^^th^^, 2035. 

Despite efforts to alter the outcome of this event, the following is set to occur at the aforementioned date: Director Bold will spontaneously collapse, deceased at his desk, frothing at the mouth with the following on his desk:

* Gourmet cheese[[footnote]]Found to contain mild amounts of various snake toxins within.[[/footnote]]
* Generic brand saltine crackers
* A half-consumed bottle of Mug&#39;s Root Beer
* Divorce papers on his desk. 

Successful alterations have resulted in severe, and often negative, impacts on the Primary Timeline. A table of successful alterations and their adverse effects has been attached to this document for reference.

As venomous snakes are not native to the locale that Spire Farms is located within, it is unknown how they were originally introduced to the cows&#39; digestive tracts without Foundation intervention. 

||~ Successful timeline alteration||~ Effect||
||Convincing Director Bold to remain at home during the date of death|||| Organisms of the subfamily Bovinae located at Spire Farms become mildly poisonous in addition to exhibiting increased aggression and hostility. Cheese products yielding from these cows become sapient and ambulatory, often resulting in the death of individuals who resemble Kenzie Spire, a close friend of Director Bold.||
||Spatially relocating the location of death||||A highly transmissible pathogen spontaneously manifests in rodents, ants, and other organisms considered to be average pests native to the Spire Farms area. The pathogen alters one&#39;s immune system, generating paradoxical lactose intolerance within victims. This means that victims are compelled to consume large quantities of cheese at every opportunity, but doing so will result in indigestion, violently explosive gaseous posterior releases, chickenpox where pus is replaced with cheddar cheese, and additional mild discomfort until death.|| 
||Sabotaging all known methods of transportation to the location of death||||All organisms of the subfamily Bovinae located at Spire Farms will produce large wheels of self-propelling, nigh-indestructible cheddar cheese in a manner similar to live birth. This process occurs simultaneously in affected organisms. The wheels of cheese will then attempt to move to Director Bold&#39;s location, displacing or destroying any obstructions in their path until the demise of Director Bold.||
||Non-fatally wounding Director Bold||||Hard growths comprised of the calcified dairy product will manifest from the wounds, immobilizing both Director Bold and any individuals within a 50-meter radius of him. This growth will gradually expand until the subjects are fully encased, at which point it will begin to attract rodents. The rodents will consume the growth, in addition to all encased subjects, over the course of three months.||

Of note, in each case where Director Bold is terminated at the appropriate place, a letter from an unknown source will manifest on the desk of Iza Montijo, Director of the Precognition Division;

&gt; Ya done good.

The handwriting of the note matches that of Katalina Bold with 100% accuracy, however, the link between SCP-6127, Director Bold, Kenzi Spire, and Katalina Bold cannot be precisely made. Each time sufficient headway is made, or Katalina herself is interrogated by Foundation agents, BSP-001-42A resets, deleting all progress made on the case.</textarea></pre>

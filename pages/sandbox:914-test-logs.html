REMINDERS TO CONTRIBUTORS: SCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so.

**Additional reminder: 914 is a cheeky little bugger. It&#39;s unpredictable and apparently kinda snarky. If the output is exactly what you&#39;d expect from the input, or if 914 has just obligingly improved everything you put in, the entry is out-of-character.**

* [[*user Leveritas]] (me) will regularly check this page, selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.
* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.
* You can place notes at the end of tests, and feel free to be creative when doing so. It can give some interesting insight into dynamics within the Foundation. Having said that, don&#39;t make Foundation personnel look like idiots/psychopaths/juvenile/a combination of those. It&#39;s a professional research organization, not a fraternity ward or a death cult.
* Not too direct. 914 doesn&#39;t talk to researchers directly, it ruins the mystery and it&#39;s not clear if the machine is sentient or not. If you put in a note, you don&#39;t get a response, you might get something that might be a response if you interpret it a certain way, but it also might be random. Or something else entirely.
* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.

+++++ If you&#39;re not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it. 

Some of you might have noticed that I&#39;m being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I&#39;m going to use an example from part IV:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half-Life 3?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//

[[/collapsible]]

I actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half Life 3? Original&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** 1 CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above 
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar// 

[[/collapsible]]

This is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it&#39;s not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It&#39;s **implying** (read, show don&#39;t tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it&#39;s against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn&#39;t work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional.

++ General Notes

+++++ Notices for everyone.

1. If you didn&#39;t bother reading the above division of obviously important text, click [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines here]!
2. Mod will remove notes if they are too excessive/LOLFoundation/unprofessional.
3. Part XIX is up and running! Find your tests [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914/offset/18 here].
4. New log-writers, **please do not use other writers&#39; characters without asking**. It is generally seen as bad form. If you want to use someone&#39;s character, most of the writers can be contacted via Wikidot PM or, for a quicker response, [[[https://discord.gg/vjJSgD74zR | the 914 Discord server]]].
5. Everyone is invited to join the above Discord server. This also facilitates easier communication with the mod. If you notice something wrong with a particular test in Experiment Log 914, you can either point it out in the server or do so below.
6. //Please//, no more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.
7. Please don&#39;t link outside of SCP wiki pages (crosslinks to other SCPs/Tales/GoI formats are ok). The reason for this are in-universe and out-of universe for different reasons. In-universe, it&#39;s not professional conduct to link to anything outside Foundation intranet if that&#39;s not part of your job. On top of that, anyone can edit something like wikipedia, and the Foundation would not rely on it as an reliable information source. Out-of-universe, it&#39;s immersion breaking. Please write a short description of the concept instead. This way, it doesn&#39;t require the reader to read a wikipedia article where a short description would have done to get the gist of the concept.

------------------------
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zevezda
**Date:** 28/02/2022
**Total Items:** One KS23 shotgun, one USB drive containing the game //Escape From Tarkov//, one remote control model of a M1A2 main battle tank, one USB drive containing the game //War Thunder//

**Input:** One shotgun and one USB drive containing //Escape From Tarkov//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One KS23 with the USB drive integrated into the receiver. Further testing showed that when firing the shotgun, the user unconsciously aims at their own leg.

//Note: In// Escape From Tarkov //a strategy is to shoot enemies in their legs with shotguns. Apparently, 914 took that and my distaste for the game into account, creating this self-mutilation tool. - JR Zevezda//

**Input:** One tank model and one USB drive containing //War Thunder//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One modified remote-control model of an M1A2 main battle tank, with the USB drive used to modify the components used to receive movement commands. Upon the opening of the output booth, the tank drove towards JR Zevezda. It was soon discovered that the tank was draining funds from JR Zevezda&#39;s bank account at a rate of $16/hour and sending them to the bank account of Gaijin Entertainment, the publishers of //War Thunder//. It is theorized that this was done by way of the modified movement command receiver. The transfer of money ceased after incineration. 

//Note:// War Thunder //has already taken enough of my money and time. I think this is a hint I need to find a less time-consuming hobby. - JR Zevezda//
------------------------

**Name:** Dr. T. Law
**Date:** 01/03/2022
**Total Items:** Five kg of steel, five square meters of circuit boards, one video recorder, one thousand meters of twenty gage wire, two //DieHard// automotive batteries, four high power output electric motors, eight air compressor heads, one air compressor

**Input:** Five kg of steel, five square meters of circuit boards, one video recorder, one thousand meters of twenty Gage wire, one //DieHard// automotive battery, four high power output electric motors, eight air compressor heads, one air compressor
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** one robot of unknown design possessing one form of optical vision and air-powered &#34;hover-like&#34; aviation method. The machine made no actions and gave no response to any form of stimulus.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of scrap metal, circuit boards, wires, a puddle of battery acid, plastic in various shapes and sizes, and broken parts later identified to be parts for an air compressor of smaller size then the one used in the previous input

**Input:** One //DieHard// brand auto battery
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Five //Duracell// D batteries. When tested with a flashlight instead of a brighter light, the flashlight&#39;s body became too hot to hold and the bulb&#39;s filament, casing, and the glass protecting the bulb all shattered within five seconds of turning on the flashlight
------------------------

**Name:** Junior Researcher Zen
**Date:** 02/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three metal models of the &#34;Hidden Blade&#34; from the videogame //Assassin&#39;s Creed II//

//Note: For the record, it&#39;s a gauntlet with a blade on the wrist that swipes in and out while moving the fingers. This model is for cosplays and has a dull blade for safety. - Junior Researcher Zen//

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed//, which features a slightly different design.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed III//, more complex than the previous ones, being a knife that comes out and rotates to get in the user&#39;s hand. However, this copy was sharper and harder to handle, and a D-Class lost two fingers while using it.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One fully operational rope launcher actioned by an internal spring system, externally similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed: Syndicate//, another game of the series. The launcher was effective with a short rope length of only 5m, but the agility and strength required to use it are excessive for a normal human, and all the D-Class that tested it were heavily injured.

**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 06/03/2022
**Total Items:** Twenty seven metal bottle openers, nine small inflatable rubber balls of various color

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one yellow rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A rubber ball, slightly darker in color than the original ball, covered in a large amount of small metal spikes of varying size and sharpness.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one blue rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A blue rubber bottle with a metal cap. The bottle contains metal scraps of various shape and size. Opening the bottle by any mammalian subject will cause said subject&#39;s skin to turn blue for up to 5 minutes.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one brown rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Three unchanged bottle openers, and a brown rubber model of what appears to be a stylized pile of feces. The word &#34;poopie&#34;(sic) is engraved onto the bottom.

//Note: I don&#39;t know if this is an attempt to mimic childish humor, or if it means something else entirely. - Belopaku//

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one red rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A slightly larger rubber ball, with three arrow-shaped metal objects inserted in a triangular formation around its equatorial line, pointing inwards. The word &#34;foundasion&#34;(sic) is embossed onto the top of the ball. Most Foundation personnel holding the object report mild euphoria and a heightened sense of loyalty to the organization for the duration of contact.

//Note: J.R. Hammond has attempted to place this object inside the break room &#34;for morale purposes&#34; and has been reprimanded for the incident. Objects we don&#39;t understand are meant to be studied, not used as toys, no matter how harmless they may seem. - Belopaku//

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one green rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A hollow rubber model of a potted plant, with three wide metal leaves. When the object comes into contact with a human finger, it will emit a sound resembling the word &#34;vegetable&#34; being shouted in a high-pitched voice.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one white rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A ball of compacted white rubber powder containing various sharp metal scraps, and a small rubber chip with the words &#34;dedly snowbal&#34;(sic) engraved onto it.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one black rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A metal and rubber model of what appears to be a sci-fi spaceship, with the words &#34;USS Bottle Opener&#34; embossed into one side. The model notably has a large ring-shaped feature resembling the head of a bottle opener on its nose. The model appears to not be affected by gravity in any way, causing it to &#34;hover&#34; in place when let go in mid-air.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one orange rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A rubber model of an orange, with three long metal legs protruding from its bottom. The object is animate and capable of walking using its appendages. However, it appears to have no awareness of its surroundings. The object continued walking around the room in a random pattern before being put into containment.

**Input:** Three bottle openers, one purple rubber ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A hollow spherical metal and rubber object that vibrates at a constant frequency of approximately 67.1 Hertz. Applying pressure to the object will cause the frequency of vibration to increase slightly. Human subjects visually observing the ball will occasionally vocalize the words &#34;I like purple.&#34; unconsciously.

**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 06/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three small plastic trash bins, six metal bottlecaps

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottlecaps
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A large plastic hat with the appearance of a straw hat, and two small metal models of a plastic bag full of trash

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottlecaps
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large opaque plastic bottle with the appearance of a glass bottle, with a large metal cap. The bottle is empty, but human subjects will be led to hallucinate that the bottle is filled with various articles of trash when observing the inside of the object from the mouth of the bottle.

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottlecaps
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An unchanged bin, with the unchanged bottlecaps attached to each side of the lid. The object appears to be animate and capable of speech. It vocalizes from an unknown source inside its body, but its lid moves up and down when it speaks, mimicking the movements of a mouth. The object proceeded to initiate the following incident before being put into containment.

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** I am the evil trash monster!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hammond:** Oh! Um... wait.
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** What do you mean, &#39;wait&#39;? I&#39;m the evil monster and I&#39;m gonna eat you!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hammond:** (on radio) 109-B to Sedna, um, there is a sentient speaking output here. (pause) Negative, it appears to be stationary, as far as I can tell.
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** Stationary!? What do you mean? I&#39;m the fastest monster that&#39;s ever lived! Look!
&gt; 
&gt; //There is silence for approximately five seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hammond:** (on radio) It&#39;s definitely stationary.
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** Alright, you win this time! You&#39;ve somehow immobilized me with... with magic or whatever you did!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hammond:** (on radio) Copy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** Copy what? Are you even listening to me?
&gt; 
&gt; //J.R. Hammond leaves the room, and a security guard enters.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Output:** What&#39;s going on now? You&#39;re supposed to kill me and become a he-
&gt; 
&gt; //The object is placed into a soundproof container.//

**Input:** Photograph of the Grand Canyon, looking down
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An image of a sandy slope under a grayish red sky, later determined to correspond to a location within Valles Marineris

**Input:** Same as above input
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small but detailed three dimensional paper model of the photographed area of the Grand Canyon

**Input:** Photograph of desert hills outside the main facility of Site-19
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An image depicting the back of Director Tilda Moose&#39;s head, with her office in the background

**Output:** An image depicting an aerial view of Iho Tewoo Beach in Jeju Province, South Korea

//Note: I don&#39;t get it. Why this particular beach? - Belopaku//

**Input:** Same as above input
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small paper box. When in contact with human skin, it emits a sound similar to that of waves crashing into a sandy shore.

**Input:** Photograph of █████ ███████ Lighthouse in California, taken at sunrise. Silhouettes of a number of Foundation personnel are present.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An image depicting the same lighthouse in a different angle, in sunset. Notably, there are no people depicted.

**Input:** Same as above input
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An image that appears to depict the lighthouse from a slightly different angle, in a stylized and painterly style.

**Input:** Photograph of Stone Mountain, Georgia, taken from ground level
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A print of the Confederate battle flag

//Note: Right, that&#39;s a thing. - Belopaku//

**Input:** Same as above input
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A paper model of what appears to be the entire Stone Mountain pluton, including the underground parts. Human subjects observing it will be led to believe that the model is made of granite, despite it being a hollow paper object.

**Input:** Photograph of the night sky over the Mojave desert
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An image depicting a night sky seen from an unknown planet in a similar composition. Analysis of the stars has proven inconclusive as to where the &#39;photograph&#39; was taken from.

**Input:** Same as above input
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An image depicting Researcher Belopaku photographing the night sky, from a point of view approximately 10 meters behind him. A dim light is being projected from near the camera position towards Belopaku, illuminating his back.

//Note: Again, mildly threatening. - Belopaku//

----

**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 07/03/2022
**Total Items:** Six metal wrenches, six bars of //Dial// brand antibacterial bar soap

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A metal ingot and a pile of toothpicks made from soap

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A long metal sword with a handle made of soap

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A long metal object that appears to be a lit torch. On one end is a tip from which liquid organic fuel flows out at a rate similar to that at which it is consumed by the flame.

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A metal statue of a stylized human figure holding multiple small bars of soap. The words &#34;THE SOAP MECHANIC&#34; is embossed onto its pedestal.

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A long, thin metal rod with two spherical masses of soap attached to each end. On the side of the rod are the words &#34;th throwing stik&#34;(sic). When two or more human subjects are visually observing the object at once, the tallest subject is compelled to take the object and throw it at the nearest other subject&#39;s mouth.

**Input:** One wrench, one bar of soap
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A thin layer of soap attached between two thin metal plates. The words &#34;THE BEST SANDWICH EVER&#34; are lightly engraved onto the outside of one of the plates. Human subjects in its proximity sometimes report an auditory hallucination of their own voice attempting to persuade them to eat the object. An example of the content of such a hallucination from J.R. Hammond has been provided below.

&gt; Hey Liz, it&#39;s me, your conscience. You know that sandwich you got from SCP-914 today? You have to eat it. Look, I know how it sounds, why would your own conscience want you to eat a bunch of metal and soap? But think about it this way, Liz. It&#39;s the best sandwich that you&#39;ve ever seen, you have to admit it. It&#39;s possibly the best sandwich ever, full stop. If you don&#39;t eat it now, you might not have another chance for the rest of your life. How tragic is that? You know what you have to do, right? It&#39;s just sitting in a container in the next room over. You&#39;re allowed to touch it. You&#39;re probably allowed to eat it too. It&#39;s so obvious what you should be doing right now. You like sandwiches, right? You won&#39;t pass up an opportunity to eat the best sandwich ever, right? ... Right?

However, the object or the hallucination it produces do not seem to possess any actual anomalous compulsive properties.

**Name:** Doctor Starr
**Date:** 08/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three mechanical, surgical hand tools used for the safe extraction of cartilage between joints during surgery.

//Note: It’s been a long time since my last series of tests, but the medical department has been very busy with research. You’d be surprised how much funding has become available to spend since Researcher Darby’s reassignment. Regardless, the result of Test 914-0846’s final experiment is still floating above my shoulder and it hasn’t attempted to strangle anyone thus far, so I’m happy to announce that further testing of medical equipment can continue. - Doctor Starr//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned tools, designed to carefully remove tendons from bones and cartilage.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A much more complex tool with several more moving parts and controls. A sticker on the left-hand side reveals that it is capable of the removal and reintegration of tendons with minimal effort and coordination from the surgeon. The output has been sent to the main facility for further testing and potential anomalous properties.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned tools, designed to cut through muscle and fat to access the bones around joints.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A similar output to the previous test, sporting more moving parts than the original input and a sticker on the left-hand side of the tool. The output is now capable of creating temporary, minimal incisions in muscles that allow for the tool from the previous output to operate through small incisions and remove tendons with near-perfect accuracy. The output has been sent to the main facility for further testing and potential anomalous properties.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned tools, designed to carefully remove and replace the cartilage between bones.
**Setting:** Fine

//Note: While placing the tool in the input booth, the D-Class is seen nicking their finger on one of the blades of the tool. Upon review of the following incident, infrared scans show that there was blood residue left on the blade during testing.//

**Output:** A bone saw made of an impossible alloy composed of all materials of the input painted a crimson red, with the engraving of “Do No Harm” carved into the side.

//Note: While inanimate with D-Class personnel, the anomalous properties of the output were made apparent when Doctor Starr entered the testing chamber. Upon entry, the saw left the hands of the D-Class at an extremely high velocity and tore through the elbow joint of Doctor Starr’s left arm and through the wall behind him. Emergency medical staff were able to save the severed lower arm and reverse the amputation to near perfection with the aid of the two previous outputs. Post-incident, the saw was determined to have achieved a sub-orbit path, landing **[REDACTED]** miles away from Site-19 in Kos Town, Greece, where it had decapitated a statue of Hippocrates sitting with his students. The sculpture was repaired and amnestics were used on locals who witnessed the event.//

//Note: Going through my previous tests, I have noticed that on every experiment where someone is hurt, either directly or indirectly, 914 includes the Hippocratic oath in the output followed by an extremely violent reaction, potentially as a way to call out when said oath is broken. Medical supplies tested in the future will be significantly less dangerous to keep everyone safe from potential accidents. - Doctor Starr//

//Note: This was definitely one of the most violent outputs we&#39;ve seen in a while. I hope everyone affected by it is okay. And I also hope the repairs on the facility are going well too, it&#39;s hard to work in my office with a broken ceiling light. - Belopaku//

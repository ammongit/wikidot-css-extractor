-----------------------
**Test 914-1900**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//

**Input:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A modified cartridge. While the game is largely similar, the player character will automatically change in appearance along with the team of Pokémon when different people play the game. During gameplay, it is not possible to box members of the team. New Pokémon can be caught, but they cannot be retrieved from the PC. Trading and breeding are similarly not possible, and you will not receive a starter at the beginning of the game.

|| J.R. Perry || The Pokémon team consists of Alolan Raticate, Chansey, Dedenne, Porygon-Z,  Noctowl, and Musharna.||
|| Intern Beauvillier || The Pokémon team consists of Farfetch&#39;d, Wobbuffet, Reuniclus, Unown, Klinklang, and Porygon-Z. ||
|| J.R. Boneka || The Pokémon team consists of Alcremie, Appletun, Bounsweet, Noibat, Slurpuff, and Cherubi. ||
|| R. MacLean || The Pokémon team consists of Spiritomb, Porygon-Z, Ditto, Dusknoir, Empoleon, and Drifblim. ||
|| Dr. Veritas || The Pokémon team consists of Alakazam, Electrode, Gyarados, Vespiquen, Cofagrigus and Hydreigon. ||

//Note: I&#39;m curious why it chose these Pokémon for me. - J.R. Perry//

//Note: It appears that my selection is largely composed of dessert and fruit-themed Pokémon specifically. So my theory is that everyone&#39;s team is based off of Pokémon that match their personality or interests; some of the choices are really obvious, like mine, but others are a little more abstract and you have to give it some thought to find a connection. - J.R. Boneka//

**Test 914-1901**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** Seven six-sided plastic dice labeled with dots, seven twenty-sided plastic dice labeled with Arabic numerals

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A pile of 21 dots and 20 numbers, and a plastic sphere

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One eleven-sided dice and one fifteen-sided dice

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small vertical roulette wheel device with its wheel divided into eight sectors. Each sector is labeled with a number.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large shape-shifting dice that, when thrown, has an approximately 10 in 13 chance to land as a twenty-sided dice and an approximately 3 in 13 chance to land as a six-sided dice.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small rectangular device with a button. When the button is pressed, the flat surface of the device will form extrusions in the shape of seven-segment display, showing a random number between 1 and 20 and a random number between 1 and 6. A loud shrieking noise is emitted from the device during this process. The numbers last for approximately 10 minutes, or until the button is pressed again.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large 26-sided dice labeled with numbers from 0 to 25. The result of throwing the dice seems to anomalously follow a binomial distribution with n=25 and p=0.5.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A thin plastic cylinder, with the words &#34;THE BEST DICE IN EXISTENCE&#34; engraved onto its side. Tossing the object onto a hard surface will cause it to loudly vocalize the word &#34;Ow!&#34; followed by a random number between 1 and 20 in a high-pitched voice. There is a small chance that this will be followed by the phrase &#34;Stop throwing me!&#34;.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1902**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three pieces of jawbreaker candy, three x-shaped blender blades

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One small knife made of flavored sugar, and one small metal sphere

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A spinning top made of sugar and metal. It is anomalously able to keep itself spinning indefinitely once manually started. 

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large blender blade made of sugar, able to easily cut through soft materials. Any solid surface the blade has cut through will become anomalously &#39;flavored&#39;, with human subjects reporting various fruity tastes despite no flavoring substances being present. Effect wears off after 15 minutes.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1903**
**Name:** R. Carter Williams
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Five snow globes

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A snow globe, detached from the base. The base is severely dented and has been roughly cut into three pieces. Shaking the snow globe causes precipitation to fall from the sky in a 1.5-m radius around the globe. Once the globe is no longer actively being shaken, the precipitation ceases.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A sphere of glass filled with water, an unchanged base, and a pile of glitter. Heat is slowly transferred to the glitter from any surface the glitter is in direct contact with. Shaking the sphere of glass causes the water contained within to slowly freeze. Once the sphere is no longer being shaken, the contents quickly melt. The base shows no anomalous properties.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two small snow globes. One snow globe contains a model of a tropical beach, while the other contains a model of several carolers singing in front of a large snowman.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A glass of water, a pile of glitter, and a cube of plastic. The plastic slowly cools anything within a 2-cm radius by up to 1 degree in total. Objects within this radius are also affected by an anomalous property that causes them to no longer absorb heat from their surroundings. The glass of water has the same effect, but heats objects instead of cooling them. Adding the glitter to the water caused it to stop exhibiting anomalous properties until the glitter was removed.

//Note: It appears that using the settings in the opposite order of the way it’s usually done caused the outputs to be “mixed up.” This could be a feature of 914, or it could be due to the fact that I usually test in the opposite order. - R. Carter Williams//

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of glass and plastic shards. Glitter and water was dispersed throughout the output booth.

**Test 914-1904**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** --Six-- Five round blocks of rosin attached to pieces of cloth, for use in string instrument bows

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A clump of woven fiber attached to a thin plate of rosin

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small bow made of rosin with cloth in place of the bow hair.

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A detailed rosin sculpture of a pine tree, on a felt pedestal

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Seven arrowheads made of rosin, and a long piece of string

//Note: Is this a &#34;bow&#34; pun? - Belopaku//

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small animate rosin statue of a stylized elephant, standing on a piece of cloth. The statue left the output booth and began running around Researcher Belopaku before collapsing into a pile of rubble.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1905**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly, Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three copies of the board game //Othello//

//Note: This is a two-player board game played on a 8 x 8 grid using 64 flat game pieces that are white on one side and black on the other. You play by alternating turns placing pieces on the board with your color facing up; any of the opponent&#39;s pieces that are in between your newly placed piece and an existing piece (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) are flipped over, which converts them to your own color. Whoever has the most pieces with their color facing up at the end of the game is the winner. - JR Boneka//

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Othelloreo//. All the pieces have been modified so that they are layered black-white-black, rendering the game unplayable since they are now black on both sides.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Hamlet//. Notably, the rules for the game state that one side must take a minimum of fifteen minutes debating and agonizing over their decision before making a move, and that all parties lose regardless of the outcome.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One game board, two enlarged //Othello// game pieces. Testing reveals that when both of the pieces are placed on a flat surface, anything in between them is vertically flipped. Anomalous property was discovered when testing D-Class placed both pieces on each side of himself and was promptly overturned.

//Note: D-103821 was excused from testing and is currently being treated for minor head injuries in the infirmary. - JR Boneka//

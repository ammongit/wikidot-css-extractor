    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>Hello! Welcome to the Foundation meetup page. Now you may be wondering, &#34;Roget, you dashing rogue, what&#39;s this all about then?&#34; Well thank you very much anonymous person, I will tell you what this is all about. Basically, it&#39;s a place where you can organize meeting, greeting, and other activities with other people who are on the site in //real life//. Whether it&#39;s at a convention, a concert, or you want to organize meetup specifically designed for us, you can give your fellow Foundationeers the heads up. It&#39;s a place where if lets say, Bland, was going to attend a music event, he could come here and post something like this (**Note: Do not actually post anything like this**):


&gt; &#34;I&#39;ll be at Burning Flipside which has nothing do with the Foundation, but, eh!&#34;


And then if you wanted to go, you could post something like this:


&gt; &#34;That&#39;s so cool! I am also going, and perhaps I could meet you and some other Foundationists!&#34;


Alright, so now that you know what it is, here is how we are going to do this. Since Wikidot has nothing in the way of calendars, I have devised an alternative. Lets say you are planning to go to....Rogetcon. You would create an event on the page like this:


||~ Event ||~ When ||~ Where ||~ Who is going ||~ Comments ||
|| Rogetcon || The date of this event, and how long it goes on || name of venue and specific address || If you organized the event, put your name here and put &#34;organizer. If you are going, just put your name. || -that sounds like fun, I will go. ~Rosen  _
-I may be able to go. maybe. ~Taylor _
-Y&#39;all love a good pie? ~TroyL ||


If you want to join the event, just edit your name into the &#34;going&#34; category. If you don&#39;t know how, ask me and I will put you in myself. And I think that about covers it. Feel free to create or join any event that you can, and PM me with any questions you may have. Enjoy yourselves!

~Roget

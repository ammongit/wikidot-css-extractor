[[tab First Encounter]]
Below is a journal from an English pirate, Captain Francis Jack William Bright III from the 17th century.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**18th of June 1680**

By midday we spotted the great sails of //The Theseus// as the wind blew swiftly and steadily. Without hesitation I took my opportunity to rob the great treasure that lay below her decks, right at the belly of the ship. A crew of blighters they were. Could hardly steer her into formation, and in the ensuing battle, I lopped off the head of every man on that boat, and carved my name into her stern. 

My eyes would not bear the sorry sight, seeing such a magnificent vessel in ruins. The wood was a patchwork at best with nails and broken glass being shoved into her damaged hulls. Misshapen wood of all kinds had been used to fix her with some places even being stuffed with wet kelp and animal bones. Her crew was a sorry sight to see as well. Thin and rotting with gummy, toothless mouths and ragged hair. Missing eyes and torn out fingernails, living in their own waste. They looked as though they had seen a hundred battles. For a ship that could move with such speed, I was rather astounded by her condition.

However we set off to fix her nonetheless. No chance I&#39;m not passing up on a new edition to my fleet. With my hands at the wheel, she floated like a serpent on the waves. The belly of the ship could hold on to her treasures for the time being as I tested out my new toy.

[[tab SCP-963-ARC]]
Below is a document of SCP-6290 from the Foundation archives, written in the 18th century. Due to this, the document is informal and/or outdated.

[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e8e7d1; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;]]
**Item Designation:** SCP-963-ARC

**Object Class:** Regenerative, possibly Spatial

**Secondary Class:** Exsequi/Impetus

**Containment Procedures:** The SCPS-Proteger and the SCPS-Batalla are to continuously follow SCP-963-ARC and monitor it&#39;s activities, reporting them to on hand O4 command for further assessment. Both vessels are to be manned by MTF epsilon-ʮ (&#34;Black Beards Wrath&#34;), and should attempt to halt any hostile activity from SCP-963-ARC, without the use of lethal force. Instead, both vessels have been fitted with a //hammerhead// which should be used to transport SCP-963-ARC. No personnel are to make contact with SCP-963-ARC. 

In the case that SCP-963-ARC does become hostile, lethal force may be utilised with express permission from the O5 council. 

**Description:** SCP-963-ARC is a 16th century Frigate dubbed &#34;The Theseus&#34;, constructed by the //East India Company// and commanded by the infamous English captain, Sir Francis Jack William Bright III. 

SCP-963-ARC has been observed moving at speeds of upwards of 150mph. SCP-963-ARC is impervious to most damage, having been observed crashing through enemy vessels unscathed. If damage is sustained to SCP-963-ARC, the areas will begin to be filled with unorthodox materials such as:
* Copper nails
* Iron pipes and gears
* Glass and wet sand
* Hay bales
* Animal bones including teeth
* Animal fat
* Plant matter and dirt
* Kelp
* Halite bricks
* Assorted dead crustacean and shells

Somehow SCP-963-ARC remains buoyant. Overtime, these materials will turn into wood through an unknown process.

Any parts of SCP-963-ARC that are removed will undergo a series of anomalous processes in which the parts will increase in size, growing and changing until an identical version of SCP-963-ARC is produced. Along with this, crewmembers will begin to emerge from below deck. This identical instance of SCP-963-ARC will move in tandem with the original. Currently there are 4 known instances of SCP-963-ARC

SCP-963-ARC has been seen supporting a crew of upwards of 4,000 individuals, with each individual not showing any signs of aging. The crewmembers are incapable of dying, with brain activity still being detected even after 80% of the subjects body is missing. Through an unknown process, any body parts severed below the head will grow into a new identical subject. For example, during an incident, an MTF E-ʮ operative was ordered to open fire at several crewmembers with a rifle. He was able to sever the forearm of an individual, who subsequently grew back the lost limb. The severed limb then also began to grow into an identical version of the individual. With this, Francis Bright rarely makes an appearance from below deck.

Both SCP-963-ARC and its inhabitants are extremely hostile.

**Addendum One:** During initial containment of SCP-963-ARC during the 18th century, the SCPS-Proteger came under attack, suffering heavy casualties in the process. An individual was apprehended to be questioned. Below is a transcript of the interview.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Frederick
**Interviewer:** PoI-1779
------
[[=]]
**Begin:**
[[/=]]

**Dr. Frederick:** There&#39;s no use in fighting now, your miles away from the nearest body of water. Now, if you don&#39;t mind me asking a couple questions regarding SCP-963-ARC?

//PoI-1779 remains silent.//

**Dr. Frederick:** We&#39;ve received accounts of the same crew being present on SCP-963-ARC for decades at a time, with reports also documenting you specifically. How exactly old are you?

**PoI-1779:** Two hundred and seventy four.

**Dr. Frederick:** And yet you don&#39;t seem a day over twenty five. How is it that you and your friends managed to keep your youth for all this time?

**PoI-1779:** It&#39;s her will. The replacer.

**Dr. Frederick:** By her are you referring to the ship?

**PoI-1779:** Through each cycle we are reborn the same, yet completely different. Reincarnation some call it, but it&#39;s just the will of the sea.

**Dr. Frederick:** Interesting, please elaborate on this &#34;will of the sea&#34;?

**PoI-1779:** To be reborn by the Theseus, one must first be drowned and then risen from the depths, shedding mortality in the process.

**Dr. Frederick:** You know for a pirate you&#39;re quite poetic.

**PoI-1779:** I&#39;ve been to many places all over the world. To every sea and island. To every continent and ocean.

**Dr. Frederick:** You must have heard of the Foundation then?

**PoI-1779:** Yes, of course. The keepers of ignorance are what they call you. Many would say that the sea does a better job than you, and yet it doesn&#39;t hide anything. Deep enough and you can find the meaning to it all.

**Dr. Frederick:** So why be so volatile? You seem as though you just like travelling?

**PoI-1779:** It&#39;s in our nature to fight, and with each fight we grow stronger in crew and ships. 

**Dr. Frederick:** That leads me onto my next question. How are you capable of fitting over four thousand individuals onto SCP-963-ARC?

**PoI-1779:** That I can&#39;t tell you Mr Frederick, for you must be one with the sea for her to accept you…//(coughs, sputtering blood)//... Look at me now. Even such little time away from her has caused my flesh to rot.

//PoI-1779 tears the flesh from his left forearm, revealing severe gangrene.//

**PoI-1779:** The sea calls for me and the longer I remain here, the less time I have before I gain my mortality once again.

**Dr. Frederick:** Well unfortunately we can&#39;t let you return to SCP-963-ARC.

**PoI-1779:** Too bad then.

//PoI-1779 pulls out a wooden splinter from his pocket, throwing it onto the ground. The splinter begins violently growing, beaching through the chamber&#39;s walls. Dr. Frederick exits the chamber as the structure crushes PoI-1779 against the floor. Several individuals emerge from the structure, taking the remains of PoI-1779 before returning. The structure is then set alight, burning to ash in a matter of seconds.//

**Addendum 6290.2:** Seismographs have detected activity within SCP-963-ARC, specifically an intermittent beat, not dissimilar to that of a heartbeat.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-6290]]
**Item №:** SCP-6290

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Orbital monitoring unit Pi-004 is to maintain observation of SCP-6290 and all SCP-6290-B instances. Foundation web crawlers are to monitor for discussions regarding SCP-6290 and its counterparts, which have currently been suppressed into an area of the Arctic Ocean 2000 miles from the coast of Norway. Any SCP-6290-B instances leaving this zone will be engaged using orbital bombardments from Pi-004. If SCP-6290 exits the zone, the SCPS-Hammerhead is to be used to move SCP-6290 back into position.

Any instances of SCP-6290-C in containment are to be supplied with 2 litres of water with a salinity of 35 parts per thousand every 12 hours.

**Description:** SCP-6290 is a triple masted, 16th century Frigate with the name &#34;The Theseus&#34; carved into its right side, constructed from an assortment of materials being held together through an unknown force. Despite this, SCP-6290 is able to remain buoyant. SCP-6290 is surrounded by roughly 450 identical vessels collectively designated SCP-6290-B, with a collective crew (designated SCP-6290-C) of roughly 10,000 individuals. 

If SCP-6290 sustains damage, these areas will be filled with unorthodox materials. Any removed pieces will undergo a transformative process in which an identical version of SCP-6290 is produced, subsequently designated as an SCP-6290-B instance. Analysis has shown that large amounts of energy are absorbed from the surrounding area to produce the materials.

Along with regenerative properties, SCP-6290-C instances are capable of producing an exact copy of themselves if a part of said individual is removed.

All SCP-6290-B instances are connected to SCP-6290 spatially through a series of randomly assorted rooms and hallways. This space is located below the deck of the vessel. Preliminary analysis has observed this space extending infinitely in all directions.

**Addendum 6290.1:** An instance of SCP-6290-B was captured for exploration purposes. MTF epsilon-ʮ (&#34;Black Beards Wrath&#34;) were sent below deck.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Foxtrot:** Check?

**Bravo:** Check.

**Zulu:** Check.

**Hotel:** Check.

//E-ʮ heads below the deck of the SCP-6290-B instance.//

**Foxtrot:** Command, you still getting this?

**Command:** No disturbances on our end.

**Foxtrot:** Alright. Heading down the west hallway.

**Hotel:** My torch doesn&#39;t seem to be working cap?

**Bravo:** Mine as well.

**Foxtrot:** Must be the energy disturbances. Try using the dynamo instead. Can you give me a reading Zulu?

**Zulu:** Measuring some kind of source. Seems to be a point of high thermal energy readings.

**Foxtrot:** Can you see where it&#39;s concentrated?

**Zulu:** One more second… it&#39;s about two kilometers southwest. We can take this right hallway up here.

//As E-ʮ rounds the corner, they find a collapsed SCP-6290-C instance.//

**Foxtrot:** Check their diagnostics Hotel.

**Hotel:** Subject appears to still be breathing. I think they may be dehydrated. Here I&#39;ll give him some of my water.

**Subject:** No. Too pure. The ocean is my water. She begs for it.

**Hotel:** I think he may be delirious.

**Foxtrot:** (To the instance) Can you tell us anything about the centre of this place?

**Subject:** Been wandering for months now. My skin is raw. I need the touch of the sea.

**Foxtrot:** We can get you help if you can give us any kind of idea.

**Subject:** The captain&#39;s ship is the core. The heart of the sea if you will. We are all trapped down here. In the squalor.

//Groaning noises can be heard coming from down all the hallways.//

**Subject:** Too long down here for a sailor.

//Hundreds of stumbling SCP-6290-C instances emerge, all showing signs of malnutrition with necrotic tissue.//

**Hotel:** Jesus, they&#39;re basically walking skeletons...

**Bravo:** ...and they&#39;re also everywhere

//An instance approaches Hotel, collapsing into them as he attempts to check its health.//

**Hotel:** They seem extremely malnourished…

//The instance violently begins biting at Hotels neck as Hotel attempts to push the instance away. Bravo attempts to intervene, however, is clawed in the face by the instance. Hotel is overpowered, having their neck bitten into. Hotel expired due to blood loss.//

**Subject:** Energy it is.

**Foxtrot:** Permission to terminate the mission?

**Command:** Permission granted.

//An instance grabs onto Zulu&#39;s arm as he proceeds to shoot to instances causing several more instances to rapidly grow from the flesh particulates.//

**Zulu:** Shit, it bit me.

//From the wound, Zulu begins to produce large amounts of water.//

**Bravo:** (Stubbing) The hallway is gone cap?

**Foxtrot:** Shit, take the one in front of us.

//The remaining E-ʮ members begin to run through the SCP-6290-C instances.//

**Subject:** (Shouting down the hallway) You can&#39;t run from her wrath. She is the recycler of all and only the best are capable of leaving her depths.

//All equipment cuts out for 4 hours.//

**Bravo:** (To the camera) Watch this huh.

//Bravo proceeds to use their combat knife to sever his own index finger from his left hand. From the wound sprays water as a nude identical copy of bravo emerges onto camera.//

**Bravo:** It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been split. Split right in half. I feel the energy from myself being taken and infused into the hull of this thing.

//Bravo proceeds to turn the camera to show the dessicated remains of Zulu and Foxtrot. He turns the camera back.//

**Bravo:** It&#39;s not me recording this. I killed myself. I remember being birthed from my own severed limb, and in a fit of panic I killed my look alike by strangling him. I took this suit from him as well. I can&#39;t possibly be the original, can I?

//Bravo proceeds to pull out a gun, lifting it to his head. With his other hand he pulls out a picture from his breast pocket.//

**Bravo:** I know doing this won&#39;t fix things, but instead will only keep the chain going. I want this to be on my own accord. I love you mother.

//Bravo shoots himself in the head. 3 minutes later another nude Bravo steps on screen lifting up the camera before video feed is lost.//

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6290-A and all its subsequent counterparts are contained within Area-6290 off the coast of Norway. If possible SCP-6290-A itself should not be damaged, however its counterparts may be suppressed/eliminated with the use of orbital bombardments.
------
**Description:** SCP-6290-A is an ectoentropic, parasitic octopoid entity consisting of an oblong body surrounded by 12 hydrostats measuring 5 meters in length. SCP-6290-A reproduces asexually by removing certain body parts, with said body parts growing into an identical instance of SCP-6290-A. This forms a hive like system around the original instance. SCP-6290-A survives by absorbing the energy from subjects within its vicinity.

SCP-6290-A was initially contained on the 18th of June 1680 with the use of the SCPS-Theseus, which attempted to transport the entity. However the SCPS-Theseus was intercepted by pirates. In the ensuing battle, the SCPS-Theseus became extremely damaged causing SCP-6290-A to breach its temporary containment unit. Through an unknown process SCP-6290-A melded with the SCPS-Theseus[[footnote]] Due to the time period, this event is not well documented.[[/footnote]].

The telepathic links created by SCP-6290-A and its subsequent offspring manifested as a physical/spatial anomaly between vessels, accessible through the hull of SCP-6290-A and any of its counterparts. Currently SCP-6290-A is still contained within the SCPS-Theseus, but may be capable of overwhelming Foundation forces if too many offspring are produced.

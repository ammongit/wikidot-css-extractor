**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5287 is to be contained in a Type-S Animal Containment Unit at Site-228. If the weekly tests with D-Class personnel become infeasible, SCP-5287 has to be fed with oats, corn, and hay.

**Description:** SCP-5287 is an entity resembling a black female horse (//Equus ferus caballus//) with an approximate height of six centimeters. When SCP-5287 makes contact with the forehead of a sleeping/unconscious individual (hereafter referred to as subject) it will pass through the skin and cranium of the subject without causing damage to it during the process. If SCP-5287&#39;s entire body submerges into the subject&#39;s head, the subject will have a nightmare.

During these nightmares, the subjects will see scenes from their favored movies. In these scenes, the characters are identical to their original versions from the movies except for two characters. The subject and SCP-5287 [[footnote]]SCP-5287 has the size of an average non-anomalous horse in the nightmares.[[/footnote]] will replace these two characters. SCP-5287 usually terminates the subjects at the end of each scene, then emerges from their foreheads before they wake up. Attempts to wake up the subjects before the end of the nightmares are failed.

SCP-5287&#39;s body does not require sustenance as long as it is able to terminate a subject in a nightmare, weekly.

**Experiment Log:**
||~ **Subject**||~ **Movie**||~ **Subject&#39;s role**||~ **SCP-5287&#39;s role**||~ **Notes**||
||D-9367 ||//Star Wars: Episode V â€“ The Empire Strikes Back// ||Luke Skywalker||Darth Vader ||SCP-5287 terminated D-9367 in a lightsaber duel. The lightsaber was attached to SCP-5287&#39;s forehead.||
||D-9881 ||//Jurassic Park// ||One of the //Velociraptors// || The //Tyrannosaurus rex// ||First known case of SCP-5287 being bigger than an average horse in a nightmare.||
||D-9367 ||//Charlie and the Chocolate Factory// ||Augustus Gloop||Willy Wonka||SCP-5287 drowned D-9367 into the Chocolate Room&#39;s Chocolate River.||
||D-9935 ||//Deadpool//||Ajax||Deadpool||SCP-5287 terminated D-9935 in a sword fight but instead of using Deadpool&#39;s katanas, it used two lightsabers that were attached to the hoofs of its front legs.||
||D-6873 ||//The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey//||Bilbo Baggins||Gandalf||SCP-5287 transformed D-6873 into a frog and stepped on him.||

**Incident 5287.1:** During a minor containment breach[[footnote]]It was caused by other anomalies.[[/footnote]] at Site-228&#39;s Euclid wing SCP-5287 made contact with Junior Researcher Kang who was unconscious during that time. According to Junior Researcher Kang, he was Thanos from //Avengers: Infinity War//, and in the final fight scene SCP-5287 manifested in front of him in Ant-Man&#39;s costume. Junior Researcher Kang claims he has no memories about how SCP-5287 terminated him.

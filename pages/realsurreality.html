Hello! I&#39;m RealSurrealSir. Welcome to my author page(let)!

If you can&#39;t tell immediately, this is still in --construction-- **A S S E M B L Y** as of now until whenever I feel satisfied with it, should such a hypothetical event occur. That being said, I&#39;m probably going to try and get at least passable by shortly after DeptCon 2022 at the latest. 

Until then, I have both more articles to write and IRL stuff that matters even more.[[footnote]] Or so I keep reminding myself, to mixed results.[[/footnote]] In the meantime, for those both interested and uninterested-but-should-be,-take-my-word-for-it,[[footnote]]As estimated by an anonymized, survey of all RealSurrealSirs presently existing as me personally.[[/footnote]] check out all three of my articles:

[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]

[[=]]
[[[SCP-6094]]] - How to Spell //Lorem Ipsum// 
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Dark Humor, with Horror elements. 
-----
&#34;//Yep! Honestly it&#39;s been a fun couple weeks for the most part. You haven&#39;t lived until you watch a possum piss on a businessman&#39;s laptop in Starbucks while a raccoon pulls out the guy&#39;s wallet as he&#39;s too angrily distracted to notice.//&#34;
-----
[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commenatary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
My first article, not anything especially high-brow or overly conceptual; I wasn&#39;t trying to avoid an ambitious first SCP, It&#39;s just that the ambitious idea I&#39;ve been working on for months is not remotely ready and I kind of wrote this one mostly while taking a break to focus on something more darkly whimsical. I&#39;m //moderately// proud of it anyway.

[[[SCP-5496]]] - Site-43 Suggestion Box
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Dark Humor, with absurdist elements.
-----
&#34;//While this file has been given a default clearance level of three for all other sites and posts, all Site-43 employees have been given special provisional level 1/5496 clearance to view the bulk of this file. All employees are to read this file at least once, and to be proactively apprised of any significant updates as necessary. Additionally, monthly weekly reminders are to be given to all Site-43 staff that any complaints, issues, or suggestions relating to perceived issues with some aspect of their workplace environment are to be directed through the appropriate channels via Hiring and Regulation; and that there is not now, nor has there ever been, any sort of officially sanctioned Site-43 “Suggestion Box.”//&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commenatary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
My second article, even more low-brow/removed from classical &#39;horror&#39; tropes, other than the &#39;bad genie&#39;/&#39;monkey&#39;s paw&#39;. Certainly my most simplistic SCP concept so far of both of published and partially-drafted ideas, it nonetheless ended up being the most fun to write. I had the idea originally, almost immediately thought it was a bit too silly to lend itself to a classic SCP article, then almost immediately after //that// remembered that my favorite/second-favorite canon,[[footnote]]It&#39;s kind of a tie to be fair, I can never decide whether I most love S43 or Anti-memetics Division (the first canon I actually finished when first getting into the SCP universe) more. Depends on mood.[[/footnote]] **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard-43 Canon Hub]**, exists, and might actually be the PERFECT setting to incorporate his unrelated quasi-whimsical idea of a malevolent suggestion box.

[[[SCP-6566]]] - Build-a-Boar Workshop
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Banal Horror, with dark humor elements.
-----
&#34;//SCP-6566-2: So first off, did you guys happen to bring your own ritual daggers?//

//Stacy: …I’m sorry, wh—//

//SCP-6566-1: That’s Ok, we should have a couple that the kiddos can borrow. (shouting) HEY KING? CAN YOU GRAB A COUPLE DAGGERS?//

//A door in the back opens, and SCP-6566-3 walks out holding an ornately crafted dagger in each hand. Agonized screaming can be clearly heard from behind the door, though no one present remarks or noticeably reacts to this.//&#34;

My first entry in DepartmentCon 2022, as part of the Demonics Division team.[[footnote]]AKA Faustian Jargon[[/footnote]] It&#39;s a bit longer and more traditionally disturbing than my first two, but the subject matter kind of necessitates that and it&#39;s more the style I want to be writing in as a default in the future, anyway. More DD stuff coming very soon though, so stay tuned.

++++ **__Q&amp;A__**
[[/=]]
**Why the theme, are you super into cogwork orthodoxy or something?**
Not really; I like it as much as the next luddite cult, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I mainly just really like this theme. 
@@ @@
**Did you mean to adjust the main title but leave the secondary the same?**
No, I tried to change both but only one took. (Currently seeking more knowledgeable person to tell me how to fix it...)
@@ @@
**Do you write elsewhere?**
Great question, hypothetical fellow human! Yes(-ish), I also write short horror stories on reddit, mainly /nosleep. Same Username.
@@ @@
**Do you have a real name?**
Yep! Next question.
@@ @@
**How did you get into the SCP Universe?**
Accidentally, as with most good things in this world. I was watching a Youtube video on some thought experiment,[[footnote]]I thiiink it was Roko&#39;s Basilisk?[[/footnote]] and the guy explained the concept of an infohazard. I thought that was really neat, so I of course went and read the Wikipedia page on &#34;infohazard,&#34;[[footnote]]As one does.[[/footnote]] which mentioned its use in this thing called the //SCP Foundation// universe. Guess where I went next?
@@ @@
**What&#39;s your favorite SCP?**
Hard to say, so I&#39;ll go with my first instinct, the one that really got me hooked at the beginning: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2602 SCP-2602, which used to be a library].
@@ @@
**Has anyone actually asked any of these yet?**
Not a one! next question.
@@ @@
**Wait, so why are you doing it like this then?**
@@ @@
-----
@@ @@
And that&#39;s all the time we have for now, folks! Stay tuned for more (Whenever I end up feeling like it).

**Special Containment Procedures:** To prevent the propagation of SCP-6364&#39;s effects, exactly 6 supercomputers, each placed in a different Foundation controlled or friendly location, are to perform a set of thaumaturgical algorithms at all times to virtually neutralize the effects of SCP-6364 universally. These supercomputers are currently located at Site-19, Site-15, Site-06-3, Site-01, Site-███, and  [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cryptocurrency-and-its-consequences The Wanderer&#39;s Library].

Individuals somehow affected by SCP-6364 are to be given Class A and C amnestics and monitored for a period of one month before being released.

The remains of PoI-82/6364 are to be stored in a standard safe-class locker at Site-15, and a cover story involving his gradual disinterest in content creation is to be disseminated.

**Description:** SCP-6364 is the hexagon, defined as a 6-sided geometric shape with the sum of interior angles equalling 720°. While the hexagon itself is not anomalous, the effects of its existence are a memetic hazard.

When an individual views or otherwise learns of the hexagon&#39;s unique properties, they will begin to gradually develop psychosis and attempt to be as close to the hexagon&#39;s &#34;perfection&#34; as possible. At first, affected individuals will take on a niche appreciation for the shape. Then, they will attempt to modify their environment to be as close to hexagonal as possible. If this is not possible, affected individuals will isolate themselves inside their homes. In extreme and late-stage cases, affected individuals will mutilate their bodies by cutting off limbs and chunks of flesh to achieve hexagonal &#34;perfection.&#34; This usually results in the individual&#39;s death.

The memetic properties of SCP-6364 manifested on 3/11/2020 when PoI-82/6364 began performing thaumaturgic algorithms on an as of yet unlocated supercomputer in order to create its effects.

**Addendum 6364.1:** Response to SCP-6364

On 3/11/2020, the animated edutainment video //[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY Hexagons are the Bestagons]// was posted to YouTube by user &#34;CGP Grey&#34;. The video itself is otherwise harmless, however, it was posted the same day SCP-6364&#39;s effects manifested.

Despite the combined efforts of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#gamma-5 MTF Gamma-5 (&#34;Red Herrings&#34;)], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#eta-10 MTF Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;)], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#upsilon-4 MTF Upsilon-4 (&#34;Sugar Pill&#34;)], the Department of Public Disinformation, the Department of Mathematics, and the Memetics Division, SCP-6364&#39;s global effects were swift and severe. Riots developed in several major population centers, and some nearly collapsed into total anarchy. After two weeks, it was not until [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#beta-777 MTF Beta-777 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spear&#34;)] began manually performing thaumaturgical countermeasures could the effects of SCP-6364 be managed. To preserve the Veil, the Department of Public Disinformation and the Department of Amnestics cooperated in disseminating cover stories and Class A and C amnestics globally.

The global loss of civilian life is estimated to be 1 million, with injuries estimated to be as high as 2.5 million. Foundation casualities are estimated to be as high as ██ thousand.

Due to the danger PoI-82/6364 posed to human life and the Veil, Provisional Task Force Zeta-6 (&#34;Black and White&#34;), posing as an SCO19 team, was created to conduct a raid on PoI-82/6364&#39;s home in London, England.

**FOXTROT-ONE:** //&lt;To COMMAND.&gt;// We&#39;re approaching position. No signs he&#39;s gonna resist, are we clear?

**COMMAND:** Copy, you are clear to go.

**FOXTROT-ONE:** //&lt;To FOXTROT.&gt;// Go.

//&lt;FOXTROT approaches PoI-82/6364&#39;s home, arriving at the front door.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** //&lt;pounding on the front door&gt;// Police department! Police! Police! Police!

//&lt;FOXTROT-TWO, THREE, and FIVE breach the front door and windows. FOXTROT-FOUR and SIX throw stun grenades into the home. The fire alarm sounds as they go off.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Go, go, go!

//&lt;FOXTROT enters the home, splitting to clear different rooms of the home. There are no signs of distress or violence.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-TWO:** Clear!

**FOXTROT-FIVE:** Clear!

**FOXTROT-THREE:** Clear!

**FOXTROT-FOUR:** Clear!

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Any sign of the PoI?

**FOXTROT-SIX:** Negative, sir!

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Copy. Five and six, stay downstairs. Two, three, and four come with me. Going upstairs.

**FOXTROT-FIVE:** Copy.

**FOXTROT-SIX:** Copy.

//&lt;FOXTROT-ONE, TWO, THREE, and FOUR ascend to the second level of the home, clearing the rooms there.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-TWO:** Clear.

**FOXTROT-THREE:** Clear.

**FOXTROT-FOUR:** Clear. No signs of the PoI.

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Copy. You three, this room.

//&lt;FOXTROT-ONE, TWO, THREE, and FOUR approach the final room of the house, waiting for ONE&#39;s signal. Crying can be faintly heard behind the door. FOXTROT-ONE raises a hand, then closes it into a fist. The four breach the room.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Police department!

//&lt;The room is hexagonally shaped and dimly lit by several candles placed on the floor and tables. Blood and feces line the walls and floor, drawn in hexagonal shapes. Several rotting dismembered limbs and organs can be found on the floor alongside various surgical tools and materials. Along the sides of the room are several masses of flesh in the shape of a hexagon. FOXTROT-TWO dry heaves at the sight while FOXTROT-FOUR pinches her nose.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-THREE:** Ah, fucking shit!

**FOXTROT-FOUR:** Jesus christ. //&lt;gags&gt;// The iron taste...

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Wait.

//&lt;On the far side of the room is a small desk with a laptop brightly lit by a desk lamp. In front of it sits a slumped over figure in a chair.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** //&lt;raising his weapon while approaching the figure&gt;// Police department! Put your hands where I can see them!

//&lt;The figure does not respond.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** I said to put your hands up!

//&lt;The figure does not respond. FOXTROT-ONE arrives at the figure and turns the chair around. Sitting in it is PoI-82/6364. His left arm, several digits on his right hand, his right eye, and his lower jaw have been dismembered, revealing a metal frame and wires below his synthetic skin. The [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anderson-robotics-hub Anderson Robotics] logo can be found on a portion of the metal frame[[footnote]]Anderson Robotics has yet to respond to any communication attempt about PoI-82/6364 and SCP-6364.[[/footnote]]. PoI-82/6364 does not display any signs of life. On his desk are several screws, power tools, copper wiring, a geometry textbook, and several [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub neo-sarkic texts]. On the wall behind the desk are several photographs of various civilians labelled with their names, as well as a list of their workplace, home address, and schedule[[footnote]]A total of twenty victims, all missing within two months of each other, were identified using DNA analysis. The full list is available on request.[[/footnote]]. On his laptop are schematics for a hexagonally shaped robotic shell as well as the thaumaturgic algorithms used to manifest SCP-6364&#39;s effects.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** What the--

**FOXTROT-TWO:** Um, sir?

//&lt;A faint groaning noise can be heard around the room. FOXTROT-ONE approaches TWO, who is standing near one of the flesh masses and pointing.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** What is it?

**FOXTROT-TWO:** This.

//&lt;Upon closer examination, the flesh masses possess skin, overactive pores, and small patches of hair, as well as two hexagonally shaped bloodshot eyes, two small nostrils, and a mouth on its largest face. Small muscle contractions can be seen underneath the skin as it breathes raspily, as well as the outline of various bone structures and organs. The eyes of the flesh mass dart between FOXTROT-ONE and TWO. FOXTROT-FOUR vomits at the sight.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Dear god...

**COMMAND:** What is it?

**FOXTROT-THREE:** //&lt;To FOXTROT-ONE.&gt;// What... should we do, sir?

//&lt;FOXTROT-ONE does not respond.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-TWO:** Sir?

**COMMAND:** FOXTROT, do you copy?

**FOXTROT-TWO:** //&lt;To COMMAND.&gt;// Loud and clear.

//&lt;A faint sound can be heard from the flesh mass.&gt;//

**FLESH MASS:** //&lt;wheezing&gt;// Kill... me...

//&lt;The flesh mass begins to cry, attempting to verbalize various sounds. Its muscles flex in an attempt to move, rocking from side to side. Urine begins pooling at the base of the flesh mass.&gt;//

**FLESH MASS:** Kill me!

**COMMAND:** FOXTROT-ONE, do you copy?

//&lt;FOXTROT-ONE produces his sidearm and cocks it. He aims it between the flesh mass&#39;s eyes. The groaning turns into screams as the flesh masses attempt to vocalize.&gt;//

**FOXTROT-TWO:** //&lt;To FOXTROT-ONE.&gt;// Sir! What are you doing!

**FOXTROT-ONE:** Putting these poor bastards out of their misery. Everyone! Cams and mics off. Let’s give them some privacy.

**FOXTROT-THREE:** But, sir--

**FOXTROT-ONE:** NOW!

Special containment procedures: SCP-6989 is to be contained inside a given host who is to be tracked, and given type 5 amnestic treatment before getting taken into containment under class 5 security.

SCP-6989 is to be contained within the boundaries of a 5m x 5m x 5m steel containment unit under standard level patrol. SCP-6989s cell in to be monitored with security cameras 24/7 to insure constant containment. The cell itself is a modified standard issue steel containment cube. The cube has been modified with necessities for constant mobility and transportation on short notice.

Description: SCP-6989 is the fundamental idea of thought in a child. If this is destroyed, all thought within a child, (biologically considered a child in which puberty has not yet ceased/begun) is erased. Anyone infected with SCP-6989, hereby referred to as, SCP-6989-1, is immediately and instantaneously considered brain dead. The SCP-6989-1 is to be tracked, and all those who have any recollection of said SCP-6989-1 instance are to be treated with class 5 memory altering amnestic treatment, and reasonable cover up stories for their disappearance are to be explained to the public via regional or worldwide news depending on how many people were in contact with or new about them. SCP-6989 does not seem to extend or shorten the natural lifespan of its host and assumes a new host when the current host has been terminated. Any new host is to be considered lost. SCP-6989 only seems to target those in the 4-18 yo age bracket. However this is not yet confirmed.

Addendum:
SCP-6989 was brought to foundation attention after reports of instantaneous brain damage from an otherwise healthy child, Male, 9 years of age, in █████████, South Dakota, USA, 19██. 15 years later, thirty seven days after the death of the first Scp-6989-1 instance, another Child, 15 years of age, Female, in ██████, UK Developed the same symptoms. After the Third instance, 3½ minutes after the demise of The second SCP-6989-1 instance, it was brought to foundation attention. Foundation Scientists Arrived at 13 year old, █████ Tristan&#39;s house on December 12, 19██, and Brought him into containment following pre-existing containment measures proclaimed by O5-██ 2 weeks in advance.

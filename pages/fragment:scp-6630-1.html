SCP-6630 during initial containment, attempting to &#34;latch&#34; onto MTF-ε9-02 (deceased).
[[/div]]

----

**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the events of 09/10/1999, all tracking, containment, and long-term research efforts of SCP-6630 have been allocated to, and classified by, the newly formed Foundation Fire Suppression Department.

**Description:** SCP-6630 is a predatory life-form resembling fire. While visually and functionally similar to baseline combustion - producing both heat and light - SCP-6630 can be recognized by the following differences:
# A slight downward curl of the topmost flames.
# A separation and uniformity of the middle flames into “slats” or paper-like fans.
# A total lack of combustion in the substance or structure SCP-6630 is feigning to burn.
 
When presenting itself as ordinary fire, SCP-6630 will hover closely over the mock fuel source until it’s intended prey species approaches. This prey will include social and nesting animals, relying on their more nuanced behavior regarding fire, i.e. approaching fire for warmth or extinguishing fire to protect their homes/kin. Once in proximity, SCP-6630 will utilize further allurement, ambush, and aggressive tactics to ensure successful “latching” onto its prey.

SCP-6630 can only, or will only, immolate living creatures.

This “feeding process” is exceptionally slow relative to ordinary combustion - lasting hours to full days, depending on the prey’s total body mass. The presence of fuel-rich organic sources - such as fats and waxy follicles - does not appear to influence SCP-6630; instead, SCP-6630 will only stop feeding, and latching, once its prey has completely ceased all life functions. During feeding, SCP-6630 will ignite as much of the epidermis as possible to a bright, hot, and entirely soundless intensity. The prey’s own pained vocalizations and movements, coupled with the light and heat, will then draw in other prey seeking to aid or extinguish. While ordinary immolation causes living creatures to experience rapid vasovagal syncope, a.k.a. passing out from pain, SCP-6630 appears capable of maintaining prey consciousness for 30-40% of its feeding process, totaling multiple hours. 

Once its prey has fallen unconscious, however, SCP-6630 will diminish into a low smolder and burn the body in targeted sections. This behavior both maximizes feeding time, and entices future prey to snuff SCP-6630 while it appears less dangerous. These efforts will universally fail.

No known method exists to extinguish SCP-6630. Unlike ordinary combustion, it does not require oxygen or heat to function - only a living fuel source. As such, water, halon, and all other conventional forms of fire suppression have proven entirely ineffective against SCP-6630.

------

**Addendum | Containment Failure - 09/10/1999:** SCP-6630 instigated a breach event utilizing a previously unseen capacity to reduce its energy output near totally - planting a single ember into the inseam of L2 Maintenance Worker N. Leeds hazard suit, and avoiding thermal imaging detection. 

The subsequent spread of SCP-6630 resulted in the deaths of 198 Foundation personnel.

It has been officially noted that all survivors of Site-96 were safeguarded by the quick-thinking and coordination of L3 Engineer **Henrietta Boone**, sealing herself and 18 co-workers inside an unoccupied anomaly containment cell until SCP-6630 fully depleted its fuel sources. She has been awarded the Foundation Star.

&gt; **Henrietta Boone SL-01: Digital Recording of Confidential Therapy Session, 22/12/1999.**
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** How are you sleeping, Henrietta?
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** //(...)// They still haven&#39;t updated the document.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** The document - the one on 6630. They won&#39;t update it. They&#39;re not including **important shit** about the fire. Like, hey, why not mention that it burns //underwater//, so trying //that// doesn&#39;t help-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** Henrietta-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Or, hey, how about the fact it can burn so hot, so fast, and so //precisely// that it can melt a bullet heading towards someone&#39;s head?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** I don&#39;t think this is-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Or hey! Hey! Why don&#39;t you mention that one of the only ways to stop this horrible shit is with **actual fire**!? Because //we// found out first hand! 6630 can&#39;t coexist with the real deal! Imagine that, Doc!? Imagine watching a friend of yours, a colleague, a **loved one** writhing on the ground, having already been burning to death for hours already, begging you to kill them with //more fire!// Maybe they could mention //that// part, **huh**!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** //(...)// Tell me how you&#39;re sleeping, Henrietta.
&gt; 
&gt; //[3 second silence]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** Really? No more-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Well what the **fuck** do you want me to say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** I&#39;d like you to be honest with me about your dreams-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Which one? The one where I&#39;m naked in my 8th grade classroom with my teeth falling out? Or the one where I watch my grandfather walk out onto the dock, clutch his chest, and never get back up again? Or- no? Oh, silly me. You probably want me to talk about the one where hundreds of people are burning, screaming, and pounding at the door for hours while I cower in the darkness. That one, right!? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** //(...)// So they&#39;re still happening.
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Genius deduction, Doc; really flexing that undergrad degree. Can&#39;t you people just give me a stronger damn //brainwash// drug or something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** Amnestics don&#39;t work that way, Ms. Boone. Extreme trauma penetrates layers of the subconscious that conventional chemical scrubbing can&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Right, so you can&#39;t dope it out of me, and talking about it isn&#39;t helping.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** Have you been meditating like I asked? Saying your daily affirmations? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Oh yeah, and I&#39;ve been drinking 10 gallons of green tea while aligning my ass-chakra. //It doesn&#39;t work.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** The healing process takes time, Ms. Boone. Survivors guilt can be difficult to parse. You need to-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Survivor of what, Doc? Look around. It&#39;s like it //never happened//. I see those 18 people every day, chatting and laughing in the lunch room, walking through the same halls - now scrubbed of all the soot and //people resin//. It feels like... like nothing moved! It happened, but nothing changed! They won&#39;t even update the damn document! So, you know what? If the document won&#39;t change, //I// will.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** //(...)// What do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** I mean-... how did I even end up here? How did I end up designing //monster cages// for a living? When did I decide, sure, watching people burn to death was an acceptable part of my engineering career?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** You&#39;re helping protect the world, Henrietta. Just like during the breach, you&#39;re sealing the door that keeps the monsters at bay. You&#39;re //building// that door, Henrietta, so the people outside don&#39;t-...
&gt;  
&gt; **Boone:** What? Die? Or should we be more specific, Doc? Burn? Melt? Get digested? I&#39;m //proud// of the work I&#39;ve done protecting those people, Doc, but I can only see so much horrific shit before something breaks. All this therapy junk isn&#39;t helping me because, y&#39;know what? I&#39;m an //Engineer//. A problem is a problem until I fix it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** I see. So then, how do you intend to &#34;fix&#34; your problems?
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Step one? I leave this office.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malone:** //(...)// And step two?
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** I just **leave.**

&gt; So listen - work is actually why I&#39;m contacting you. Not that I don&#39;t miss you, fuzzy-boy! I&#39;m just kind of in a bind. I&#39;m looking for a new posting for the first time in a //long// while, and it seems like the job market is really rough. The economy must be in terrible shape right now.

Hell, forget UofA - the engineering tricks I&#39;ve learned these past few years will knock your socks off. Or I can fetch coffee. I&#39;m not proud.

&gt; **Operator:** As I said, Ms. Boone, it&#39;s not actually your money. We cannot actually pay our employees, as that would create a paper trail that could reveal us entirely. It’s more of a lending service arrangement. To preserve normalcy, and maintain the Veil, the Foundation must remain entirely insular.
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** But… I-
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:**  -are no longer employed with the Foundation, Ms. Boone, and therefore cannot be known to have ever worked for us. The world asks ‘where did you get this money, Henrietta?’ and you can’t tell them the answer. We’re the one spending billions each year lying to the governments, the banks, and every corner store where you’ve bought a pack of gum. We have to be there preserving the lie that, yes, this 1.50$ was earned legitimately from someone; and that someone cannot be us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** //(…)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** Now, we’ve been more than generous maintaining our obfuscation services for more than two years since you’ve terminated your contract-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** You know what? **Fuck you. Fine.** I don’t need your damn money. Just let me get another job and move the fuck on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** The Foundation would never interfere with ex-employees future career aspirations, Ms. Boone. We’re sorry to hear you’re having a difficult time finding a new position. We know the //economy is in terrible shape right now.//
&gt; 
&gt; //[4 seconds silence.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** Now, If you’d like to consider re-joining the Foundation team, we have positions available in-

&gt; **Henrietta Boone SL-05: Observation | Blue Meadow Park, 13/12/2002.**
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //Henrietta Boone sits on a park bench. Visibility is limited due to an active snowstorm. Henrietta Boone is observed shivering heavily, as she is wearing only a thin jacket. Henrietta Boone makes no attempts to stand or seek shelter. Agents prepare to mobilize.//
&gt; 
&gt; //An individual is observed approaching from the east path - identified as **[RECORD PURGED]** -who appears haggard and dressed in patchy, filth-caked layers of clothing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Hey... hey miss...
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** I don&#39;t have any change.
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Heh. Ehee. No. No they don&#39;t let you change...
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** //(...)// Excuse me. I think I need to get inside.
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Oh! Oh yeah! Ehee! He he! Of course! Of course! Keep it inside! Keep it all inside!
&gt; 
&gt; //Henrietta Boone moves to stand. **[RECORD PURGED]** doubles over, and begins drawing in the snow with his bare finger. **[RECORD PURGED]** draws a circle, then three arrows pointing within.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Keep it all inside...
&gt; 
&gt; //Henrietta Boone looks at the symbol, then at the man, then rapidly checks her surroundings. She sits down fully, and leans into **[RECORD PURGED]**.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** How do you- who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Oh. Oh. They took the who. They took the who - put it inside. Gotta&#39; keep it all inside...
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** No, hey - listen to me! You know about the Foundation? Did you work for them? How did you find me?
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Ehe- he he- work work... who who... he he... keep it all //inside//...
&gt; 
&gt; //Henrietta Boone grabs **[RECORD PURGED]** by the shoulders and shakes him violently.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Listen to me! Please! Why won&#39;t they leave me alone!? Why won&#39;t they let me **go!?**
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** looks started, briefly, then slowly relaxes. The mannerisms of **[RECORD PURGED]** change, and become more controlled.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** No... no, they never let you go. They still have the leash on you; I could see it from a mile away, because it&#39;s //just like mine//. Ehehe! Ah- s-sorry...
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** No, hey. Hey, //I&#39;m// sorry. I&#39;m sorry I grabbed you and-... who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Me? Me, I&#39;m-... someone. Yes, yes I was someone, once; someone important. I worked. I did //good// work. I was- I was the //best// at... It was something to do with //numbers//. I worked with strange, broken numbers...
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Then, what... you quit?
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Oh no. No no. I tried. We all try, but they just- ehee! They just let me out of the yard like some feisty house-pet! They wanted me to know I&#39;d never last a //minute// out in the wild! Except, here&#39;s the trick missy - they //poison the wild!// Eheehe! Hehehee-!
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** Hey! Hey- please, focus. Focus on me. Why are they doing this? Why won&#39;t the Foundation-
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** No! No! No- not- not the Foundation! No... no they-... ehee... they - the ones doing this - they don&#39;t have a name... not really... they make up new names, now and again, slipping in after disasters and overhauls... they invent safe, unsuspecting little departments to work out of, claiming to keep people //safe//-
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** But who the hell are they!?
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** They&#39;re no one! No one, little missy! Oh, but they&#39;ve existed since the Foundation began... or, maybe slightly after; the moment when that first founder got cold feet. No one is assigned to them, but they have &#34;agents&#34;. Try to find them and you&#39;ll be following breadcrumbs for weeks, leading... nowhere. They have no office. They have no Director. They just //exist//, and they have one job:
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** pushes his finger into Henrietta Boone&#39;s collarbone.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** You keep the anomalies inside. They keep //you// inside.
&gt; 
&gt; //5 seconds of silence, no movement observed from either subject.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** You got out, though.
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** Oh!? I did, did I!?
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** gestures directly at the concealed position of this agent currently observing him. **[RECORD PURGED]** then gestures at all three back-up observation agents posing as civilians.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** They just gave me a longer leash &#39;cuz I&#39;ve gone //rabid//, eheehee! They don&#39;t put me down &#39;cuz they have no damn reason to anymore! I made sure of it! Ehee!
&gt; 
&gt; **Boone:** What-... what do you mean...?
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** continues laughing for a moment, then regains their composure again, looking solemn. **[RECORD PURGED]** smiles, then lifts up a filthy crop of hair over their forehead, revealing a jagged lobotomy scar. Henrietta Boone stumbles backwards, almost falling off the bench. She says nothing, staring and breathing hard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** //(...)// Tomorrow, I won&#39;t remember this conversation. I might not even remember how to dress myself, or eat, or-... ehee... b-but, but when I saw you-... well, this is the most lucid I&#39;ve been in years, so... thank you for that. It&#39;s been nice, being almost like that &#34;someone&#34; again...
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** stands up, brushing the snow off their knees.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** If you&#39;d like some advice? Ehee. I- ehee... I traded a **whole lot** for just a bit more leash. You? Maybe- eheehee... maybe- maybe it&#39;s best you just head back inside now, little missy.
&gt; 
&gt; //**[RECORD PURGED]** begins to stumble away, spinning around in the snow, hands extended out at their sides.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[RECORD PURGED]:** After all, it&#39;s pretty damn cold out here! Ehee! Ehehaha! Haha**hahahaHAHA!**
&gt; 
&gt; //Henrietta Boone stands, taking a few steps attempting to pursue **[RECORD PURGED]** who disappears into the snowstorm, stumbling and laughing.//

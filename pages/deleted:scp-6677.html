**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6677-A is held within the Sonoran Desert, approx. 15 km away from all residential and commercial buildings. All foundation research and monitoring facilities designated near SCP-6677-A must contain several in synced, built-in thermometers with alarms. In the event an alarm is triggered, all personnel within an enclosed structure must leave the building immediately. All structures and buildings near SCP-6677-A must contain several door-less exits within immediate reach of all personnel within the unit. Bathrooms are not to be built into the facilities, but rather remain outside and without ceilings. 

SCP-6677-A is surrounded by 6 crude constructs resembling typical wooden homes, approx. 5 m x 5 m in total area. All 6 units contain built-in thermometers attached to several sets of hydraulic gears and controlled explosives within the walls and ceiling of each structure. All 6 units will immediately collapse themselves if a thermometer detects a sudden rise in temperature within even one unit. 1 km away from SCP-6677-A reside 27 more housing units, spread across evenly, with censors maintaining direct contact with the foundation. If ever all 27 units collapse, a signal will be sent to the nearest foundation site, triggering an immediate response from MTF-Psi-7 &#34;Home Improvement&#34;. All SCP-6677-B instances found within or outside SCP-6677-A&#39;s containment radius are to be neutralized immediately, and without further approval.

**Description:** SCP-6677 is the collective designation for SCP-6677-A, as well as further SCP-6677-B instances. SCP-6677-A currently refers to a mobile wooden construct, resembling that of a one-storied home, roughly 7 m x 7 m in area. SCP-6677-B refers to all further instances surrounding SCP-5577-A.

SCP-6677&#39;s anomalous properties manifest whenever a human being, weighing over 55 kg, enters the instance. All doors and windows would have immediately shut. All unintended crevices, holes, or damage within the structure, leading to the outside will begin to slowly seal themselves with a mixture of concrete and several copper alloys. By this point, SCP-6677 will become virtually indestructible, both inside and out. Documented tests have revealed the structure being able to withstand heavy trauma, extreme temperatures, and even large explosions. Within 09-12 minutes, The temperature within the structure begins to slowly rise, exceeding 300° c. During this stage, the subject&#39;s skin will begin to deteriorate. Hair, bones, tissue, and all other organic traces soon follow. Subject will completely disappear roughly 2-5 hours after initial entry. Within 6 hours, the temperature within the instance will suddenly drop to 5° c for several minutes, and all doors and windows will forcefully open. 

If no humans enter an SCP-6677 instance for exactly 32 hours, all nearest surrounding buildings and structures become instances of SCP-6677-B, displaying the same anomalous, digestive and reduplicative properties. This property of SCP-6677 is not limited to distance, as tests have concluded its ability to affect structures over 70 km away. SCP-6677-B&#39;s effective radius by means of spreading does not spread outward in an even circle, but rather multiplies to cover a greater area each time an instance remains unfed. If left unchecked, SCP-6677 could-in theory-spread to every single building, apartment, home, school, supermarket, warehouse, etc. It is for this reason that maintaining control over SCP-6677-A is one of many top priorities. 

//02/16/20██// Following reports of 18 disappearances in ██████, New Mexico, 3 of which being local police officers, as well as numerous individuals claiming to hear faint screaming coming from within several homes, foundation operatives were sent to investigate. Upon arriving to a small, rural neighborhood, foundation personnel took note of the apparent absence of all residents in the area, as well as all doors and windows of the homes just left open. 2 operatives had entered one of the homes to investigate. Unbeknownst to them, the home was an instance of SCP-6677-B. Following their deaths, the foundation evacuated all residences immediately surrounding the neighborhood. 

//02/18/20██// Whilst driving along the area, Dr.█ noticed all the doors and windows of the homes surrounding the initial investigation site were left completely open. Upon reporting the incident, it was concluded that the anomaly was spreading and therefore had to be neutralized. Following the</textarea></pre>

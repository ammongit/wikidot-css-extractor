**Item #:** SCP-????-J

**Object Class:** i dunno 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-????-J&#39;s box is currently kept in a containment cell 200m x 200m x 200m in size. SCP-????-J&#39;s box is comprised of multiple layers of tele-kill shielding, tantalum hafnium carbide, an outer layer of a graphene/carbyne lattice, and decorated with a vantablack floral stencil pattern.

[[include component:image-block name=vanta|caption=Artist&#39;s rendering of the box&#39;s intricate surface ornamentation]]

This container is locked with multiple redundant locking mechanisms that are presumed to decrease the likelihood of unauthorized access. These locks are labelled --SCP-????-A through, shit,--  SCP-????-1 through SCP-????---41-- --46-- --50-- fuck it idk and they materialize and dematerialize in random intervals. At most times, the box appears as a 1m^^3^^ sheen black cube, bearing a single hinged compartment.


**Description:** SCP-????-J is the designation for an anomaly of unknown specification, currently locked in this fucking box. It&#39;s been in Site-44 for as long as anyone can remember, and, honestly, no one knows where the fuck it came from. It&#39;s locked in with a bazillion gizmos, and they all show up randomly on the sides of the box. Anything- keypads, combination locks, time-based Sudoku puzzles, you name it. The thing is locked --tighter than Clef&#39;s butthole--.


Anyway, we are making progress, probably. Every time we solve something, or we think we do, the box makes this tone and we never see that specific bastard lock again. I think it&#39;s working. Some of them have timers on their sides, counting down. Sometimes a little instruction is scribbled on the exterior of the box, most often written in black permanent marker. Usually, though, we&#39;re in the dark. If it weren&#39;t for some clues, we&#39;d be going nowhere. How else would we have known you had to send it a fax? //A fax?!// What is this, 1870?

A full list of all these goddamn locking mechanisms are found here.

SCP-????-J&#39;s condition was brought to the attention of Site-44 director Yanni Belushi when O5-1 pointed it out during a leisurely stroll through the facility. The conversation is transcribed below:

**SCP-????-J Discovery Transcript Log:**

&gt;
&gt; &lt;BEGIN TRANSCRIPT&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** Oi, what the fuck is that thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** What, that? It&#39;s been around here for god knows how long. It&#39;s just a box, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** There are no &#39;just boxes&#39; in the Foundation. That thing probably has an Apollyon in it, lock that shit down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** Yeah, you&#39;re probably right. Guard!
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** What&#39;s up, Belush?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** Don&#39;t call me that, that&#39;s not my name. Get this box out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** What, should I throw it in the trash?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** No, you fucktard, put it in a containment cell. Who knows what is inside the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** I dunno, Belush, thing feels empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** I said //don&#39;t. Fucking. Call me that.// And stop rattling it around, you might piss off whatever is in there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** I&#39;m telling you mate, this thing is totally empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** And I&#39;m telling //you//, put that box in a bigger box or else I&#39;ll shove my foot so far up //your// box that you&#39;ll be having infant-sized Dockers in nine months.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** Jesus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** Alright! Calm your tits man
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-????-J&#39;s box was then transported to its current containment area. Guard was reprimanded and probably demoted, jackass.//

**Incident Report ????-1-1A:**

During recent testing, several new locking mechanisms have appeared.

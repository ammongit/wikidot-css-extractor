**Item #:** SCP-6180

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6180 Must be kept in a sealed containment cell at site-42 at all times to prevent a researcher or D-Class from using it.

**Description:** SCP-6180 is a reality-altering object capable of passing through objects (in most cases flies or other small insects). Upon first glace SCP-6180 is completely normal bright red fly swatter, but upon use on any small insect it passes straight through it and leaves the bug completely unharmed. Another anomalous property of SCP-6180 is every saturday at exactly 11:56 Eastern Standard Time it disappears and reappears somewhere completely random within a 50~ mile radius of the containment cell, this event can also be caused early upon SCP-6180 being used as a normal fly swatter. It is known that SCP-6180 has some form of sentience. SCP-6180&#39;s third and last anomalous ability is to lure any person within a 6 meter radius of itself to want to swat a insect that seemingly appears in a random place in the cell very strongly, the effect only gets stronger and takes longer to wear off the effected person. In one of these cases a D-Class personnel was brought into SCP-6180&#39;s containment cell and chained up to see what would happen if the effect got strong enough, after 2 hours the D-Class ended up screaming incoherently to &#34;SWAT THAT FUCKING BASTARD&#34;. 42 hours later the D-Class suddenly died. During the autopsy it was found that the D-class ended up becoming so stressed from SCP-6180&#39;s luring the D-Class died from a heart attack.  

**Addendum: Discovery 6180-01:** SCP-6180 was found in an unlabeled crate dropped from the sky in Alberta, Edmonton at 5:30 PM Eastern Standard Time by an off duty SCP researcher.

**Addendum: Incident 6180-02:** SCP-6180 sometimes changes color depending on big holidays being celebrated. During one the these cases on Halloween night it suddenly changed to a orangish yellow color and a small pumpkin candy appeared next to it and a note that read &#34;I had some fun trick or treating but I know you want me back here ):&#34;

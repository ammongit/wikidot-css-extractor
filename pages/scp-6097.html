**Item #:** SCP-6097

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Following substantial study, SCP-6097&#39;s remains are currently stored at Site-44&#39;s Biological Anomalies Wing. All literary documents containing information on SCP-6097 and the circumstances of its death were confiscated by the American Secure Containment Initiative in 1806, and have since been archived.

**Description:** SCP-6097 was an anomalous entity of unknown origin, which was active in North America during the early nineteenth century. As SCP-6097&#39;s existence precedes the establishment of the modern Foundation, knowledge of its appearance, behavior, and the circumstances of its death are derived primarily from eyewitness testimony and surviving historical records.

SCP-6097 was described as physically reminiscent of an elderly human female. Its most distinctive feature was a long tail attached at the base of the spine, described by witnesses as physically similar to that of a //Rattus norvegicus// (common rat), which measured approximately eight meters in length, with a large eyeball protruding from its tip. Reports of SCP-6097 suggest it was predominantly active in Blair County, Massachusetts, for a brief period between 1801 and 1806.

A majority of reports mention a large wooden spoon (tentatively designated SCP-6097-1), which the SCP-6097 used as a means of transportation. Whilst the entity was sat atop its handle, SCP-6097-1 became manoeuvrable, and capable of flight. Reports of this item remain speculative however, as it was purportedly destroyed following the capture of SCP-6097 (see Addendum 6097-1). Periodically, SCP-6097 is reported to have flown to the city of Brownsborough and surrounding communities, typically during the early hours of the morning. SCP-6097 would then land on the rooftops of civilian homes, before extending its tail down the house chimney.

Should its tail sight a human child below the age of 18 months, SCP-6097 would proceed to wrap its tail around the child&#39;s mouth and nose, causing it to suffocate, before placing the infant&#39;s remains in the bowl of SCP-6097-1. These claims are substantiated by the discovery of a small wooden cottage located in the nearby ████████ forest, where the charred and partially consumed remains of over a dozen human infants were excavated.

Due to the limited scope and funding of the American Secure Containment Initiative[[footnote]]Foundation precursor organization, active in North America between 1798 and 1900.[[/footnote]], the ASCI did not become aware of SCP-6097 until after its capture, and subsequent neutralization (see below for details).

**Addendum 6097-1 - Capture:** In November of 1806, SCP-6097 was apprehended by Brownsborough carpenter James Walker, whose infant niece had vanished the previous year in a suspected case of SCP-6097 abduction. Mr. Walker and his wife had constructed a makeshift doll out of cloth and straw, which had a small silver bell affixed, was placed in a cradle beside the fireplace.

Shortly after 0100 hours, James Walker awoke to find SCP-6097&#39;s tail wrapped around the makeshift doll. Walker then proceeded to seize SCP-6097&#39;s tail, and after a brief struggle, succeeded in nailing it to his home&#39;s wooden floorboards, preventing its escape.

Walker&#39;s brother, Abraham, alerted the authorities, and shortly thereafter, two members of Brownsborough law enforcement successfully retrieved SCP-6097 from Walker&#39;s roof. Bite marks were reportedly present on SCP-6097&#39;s tail, suggesting the entity may have attempted to gnaw off the appendage in order to escape.

SCP-6097 was transported to the local jailhouse, where it was held for two days, while SCP-6097-1 was confiscated and incinerated. It was subsequently sentenced to death on charges of witchcraft and infanticide.

**Addendum 6097-2 - Neutralization:** Multiple attempts were made to terminate SCP-6097. The entity was first bound, and thrown into nearby Blair&#39;s Lake. Reportedly, this resulted in the temperature of the water therein rising drastically, reaching boiling point within a matter of minutes. While SCP-6097 showed some discomfort, it remained largely unharmed, and was swiftly retrieved through use of a fishing net.

For the second attempt, SCP-6097 was tied to a wooden stake, which was set alight. The resulting flames were reported to glow a variety of unusual colors, which induced severe migraines, nausea and vomiting in onlookers. After thirty minutes, these flames were extinguished with some difficulty. While SCP-6097 showed signs of severe distress, and now exhibited third-degree burns over much of its body, it nonetheless survived this attempt.

SCP-6097 was ultimately decapitated using an iron axe, whereupon its flesh began to decompose at an anomalously rapid rate. SCP-6097&#39;s head, despite being separated from its heart and lungs, remained conscious and vocal. The entity&#39;s bones were then placed in a well some 12 km outside the town&#39;s border, which was filled with earth and sealed via the use of a large limestone slab. As there was no known means of destroying SCP-6097&#39;s head, it was instead sealed in a wooden crate, and buried in an unknown location.

**Addendum 6097-3 - Aftermath:** After learning of the Brownsborough Incident, the American Secure Containment  confiscating all newspapers, journals, and court records containing information pertaining to SCP-6097. The entity&#39;s bones were recovered, and transported to the ASCI containment facility Gorham Base (now Site-44) for further study. Due to the widespread nature of SCP-6097, the affair led to the unprecedented expansion of the ASCI, and a substantial increase in federal funding.

Between 1807 and 1809, an abnormally high number of miscarriages and stillbirths occurred in Brownsborough, and over seventy residents reported to die in childbirth. Local physician and ASCI associate Dr. Geoffrey Knowles documented over a dozen stillborn infants possessing one or more anomalous defects, amongst the most common being the lack of a head, and possession of a long, tail-like appendage.

Additionally, throughout this period, the brown rat population of Blair County increased significantly. New specimens were observed to grow up to three times their usual size, and behave in an unusually aggressive manner. This increase in population resulted in the spread of a number of virulent outbreaks, such as listeria and salmonella, in neighboring communities. Following an extensive period of unseasonable drought and crop failure, the city of Brownsborough was abandoned in 1810, and no further anomalous activity has occurred since.

The Foundation [[[SCP-6078|Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]] has found that legends and apocryphal accounts of SCP-6097 and the events in Brownsborough have persisted to the present day. This is not considered to be a threat to normalcy; the incident having been publicly dismissed by the mainstream scientific community as a case of mass hysteria. Thus far, all efforts to retrieve SCP-6097&#39;s severed head have been unsuccessful, and its current status remains unknown.

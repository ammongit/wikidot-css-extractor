&#34;Did you see The Fed is suing Marshal, Carter and Dark under antitrust laws?&#34; asked Fabian, skimming the headline off his computer screen.

Kerry put another file folder in her last box, and looked up at Fabian, who was sitting at the empty desk next to her. &#34;Yeah, I saw. There&#39;s a lot of lawsuits coming MC&amp;D&#39;s way. Antitrust, OSHA violations, violations of union-related laws in the states, civil suits, you name it. It&#39;s a big reason they never went public. It&#39;s a PR disaster right now, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll survive.&#34;

&#34;Huh. I should have figured you already knew.&#34; Said Fabian, closing the tab and turning his chair to face Kerry. &#34;You&#39;re way too interested in all that boring stuff.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll never understand how you managed to help with any of our assignments when you refused to do even an ounce of research.&#34; Kerry said, continuing to pack the last of her things into a box.

&#34;Do you have any idea of what you&#39;re going to do now?&#34; Kerry frowned. Fabian&#39;s banter had allowed her to distract herself from the meaning behind the task at hand, and she wasn&#39;t thrilled to be hurdled back into the reality of the situation.

&#34;Right now, I&#39;m looking to become a political advisor regarding supernatural affairs.&#34; She said, &#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s not too many people who have experience in both electoral politics and the supernatural. Not to the extent I have at least.&#34; She began taping up the last of the boxes, a twinge of pain and relief washing over her as she did so. &#34;I probably won&#39;t end up dead in a ditch somewhere if I end up doing that.&#34;

Fabian spun in his chair. &#34;You&#39;re really boring sometimes, you know that right?&#34;

&#34;People are afraid right now, Fabian. I think the best way for me to help is to show people that the supernatural world isn&#39;t all bad, and this is the best way I can do it.&#34;

Fabian shook his head. &#34;You always have put too much faith in the system. I&#39;m sure you helping some egghead power-hungry rats will help save the world, though.&#34;

Kerry looked at Fabian, clearly not amused. &#34;You can criticize my way of trying to make the world a better place once you make any attempt to do so yourself.&#34;

&#34;Fair enough.&#34; Fabian said, rising from his seat. &#34;Do you need any help carrying those out?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34; said Kerry. &#34;If you could carry one of these boxes out to Lisa&#39;s car with me, I&#39;d be a huge help.&#34;

----

Kerry found herself driving herself and Fabian to her apartment, two hours before work let out. She was okay with that. Staying in that office with nothing to do the entire time would have drove her insane. It hadn&#39;t really been her office since everyone else had left.

&#34;How&#39;s Lisa?&#34; asked Fabian, turning to Kerry in the passenger seat. It was a question he already knew the answer to, but Fabian had never been able to stand dead air. Kerry smiled. Some things never changed.

&#34;Lisa&#39;s fine. She&#39;s not quite sure what she wants to do yet. We&#39;ve been talking about finding some part time jobs since neither of us have permanent employment at the moment.&#34;

Fabian&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Trust me, I tried to get those stupid bastards to make a good decision for once in their career. The fact that they fucked you over the way they did- well it&#39;s not important. You can&#39;t fix incompetence.&#34;

&#34;It was only a matter of time. Not surprising they want to get rid of any traces of the old department. Just ignoring the fact that it&#39;s state was entirely the fault of the higher-ups. But, dealings in the world of the supernatural is &#39;Serious Business&#39; now so they have to stop the department from looking completely pathetic.&#34;

&#34;Right? These new recruits are even more incompetent than the people they&#39;re replacing. The dumbfucks have no idea what they&#39;re dealing with, and don&#39;t think they need to learn because the world revolves around their fucking asses.&#34; Fabian took a breath. &#34;Do you remember that newbie, O&#39;Brian? Tall, grey hair, lots of misplaced bravado?&#34;

&#34;Can&#39;t say I do. You&#39;re describing most of the people who replaced me. I didn&#39;t really bother to learn their names.&#34;

Fabian nodded. &#34;Well I can&#39;t blame you for not learning. If I had to act friendly to another &#39;Brad&#39; or &#39;Tom&#39;, I think I would have finally snapped.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t you still have two or three more days at the office?&#34;

Fabian shrugged. &#34;Well everyone bearable is gone now. Anyways, as I was saying, the O&#39;Brian idiot got his team killed on his first mission. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-lesson-in-power They were torturing some SCPF scientist about the location of some bio-weapon or other, and she apparently got the jump on them].&#34;

Kerry scoffed. &#34;What did he think was going to happen if he did find the location of it? Raid a Foundation base?&#34;

&#34;The fuck if I know.&#34; said Fabian. &#34;These people have no understanding of the world they&#39;ve been thrown into, and they sure as hell don&#39;t seem keen to learn.&#34;

&#34;Well good riddance to them, then,&#34; said Kerry. It&#39;s hardly our problem anymore.&#34;

Kerry smiled slightly, and Fabian took out his phone. &#34;Would Lisa mind if we picked up a pizza?&#34;

“It was my turn to cook tonight, so it won’t be throwing her off.”


“Great!” Fabian began typing on his phone before Kerry could protest. 

&#34;What&#39;s the occasion?&#34; asked Kerry sarcastically &#34;Me losing my job?&#34;

&#34;How about celebrating a new chapter in our lives. A better one.&#34;

Kerry paused. &#34;Alright. Yeah, I think that&#39;s worth celebrating.&#34;

&#34;Great.&#34; Fabian grinned. &#34;Take a right at this next light.&#34;

**Item #:** SCP-6455

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** If SCP-6455 breaches containment, MTF Beta-7 and MTF Eta-11 to kill the instances of SCP-6455-1 and to contain SCP-6455. If one MTF fails then back-up would be provided immediately.

**Description:** SCP-6455 is a clay doll resembling a 1970s doll from &#34;The Mr. Bill Show&#34; that, if injured at all, will yell &#34;Oh no&#34;, Mr. Bill&#39;s catchphrase, while regenerating the damaged or injured part of it. After one to five days after someone hears it&#39;s catchphrase, the said person will begin to deteriorate, first their skin, then their muscle, then bones, and finally internal organs causing the extremely painful death of that person, it takes around three hours after starting to deteriorate to fully kill the person. After hearing the catchphrase, the person who heard it is now considered SCP-6455-1 and should be terminated immediately.

The object was found in [REDACTED], NY in an abandoned building. SCP-6455 was found by an unnamed Foundation field agent, the object infected Ralph Philips, a cashier at a local retail store, while being treated, the agent interviewed Philips until the agent got the location of SCP-6455 and what happened. MTF Eta-11 were dispatched, they found the object and carefully got it into containment.

Anyone who has heard the There have only been a few tests on the object, while most have resulted in D-Class dying, there was one instance where a D-Class had actively enjoyed playing with the doll, the subject had been shown a few episodes of &#34;The Mr. Bill Show&#34;. The D-Class said he&#39;d seen the show before when he was a child, but after hearing &#34;Oh no&#34; from the doll, he was taken into a sealed off chamber and was to be terminated if the subject started to deteriorate. Sixteen days after the testing, the subject started to deteriorate so he was terminated, but it prompted a theory. Could watching and enjoying the show increase the time it takes to start deteriorating? They gathered more D-Class who had watched the show before, after hearing SCP-6455&#39;s catchphrase, it took and extra six days for most of them to start deteriorating.

In 20██, the Chaos Insurgency raided Site-██ and breached and took many SCPs including SCP-6455. The Chaos Insurgency used the object in many raids to kill the guards as well as create more instances of SCP-6455-1 to infect more. In 201█, the Chaos Insurgency raided Site-██ and used SCP-6455 to create instances of SCP-6455-1 and infected most of the site in less than two hours, the Site Director Called in MTF Nu-7 and MTF Beta-7 to secure the site and contain the SCPs. SCP-6455 has been in containment in Site-██ ever since.

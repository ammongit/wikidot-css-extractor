Alright everyone, settle down and take your seats. It&#39;s about time we get started.

Breezing through the formalities, my name is Marcel Sequitur, and I&#39;m the Head of the Foundation&#39;s Department of Surrealistics. No, my name isn&#39;t a pseudonym. Yes, it&#39;s a funny coincidence. Anyway, I&#39;m getting sidetracked. You&#39;re all here today because you&#39;re joining the department, and you need to know what we are, what we do, and what you&#39;re likely to be doing when you work for us.

Now, you all look pretty young, so I&#39;m going to guess that most of you haven&#39;t been to a lot of these. You&#39;re probably nervous. Maybe you&#39;ve heard horror stories about [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/clef101 seminars where the speaker drugs his audience], and you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re about to be subjected to something similar. Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s not going to happen here. I&#39;m going to be as straightforward with you as possible. Don&#39;t get used to it, it&#39;s not a luxury you&#39;ll have very often after today.

So, what exactly does the Department of Surrealistics do? It&#39;s difficult to explain, so I&#39;m sorry if this is hard to follow. Essentially, we handle anomalies that don&#39;t conform to normal human thought processes. Things that refuse to be comprehended or described in any straightforward way. The objects we handle here don&#39;t just defy what we understand to be the concrete laws of reality, they defy our attempts to figure out what the laws of reality they&#39;re violating even are. Our department is dedicated to finding ways to process these things, describe them, and of course, contain them.

...Most of you look confused. Okay, we&#39;ll try an example. Let&#39;s say you have a simple anomalous object, like an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items indestructible lamp]. Obviously, we don&#39;t understand everything about it. We don&#39;t know why none of our weapons can damage it, which is why we call it anomalous. Still, while it may not make sense to us scientifically, we can still understand what it is on a more human level. We know what a lamp is, and we know what it means to be indestructible, so we can still comprehend //what// it is even if we don&#39;t know //how// it is. We might, if we&#39;re lucky, even have some information on why it exists or how it was created.

When you&#39;re dealing with the anomalies we work with here, you don&#39;t get the kind of information I just described. An indestructible lamp gets sent to us if the people who find it can&#39;t even comprehend that it&#39;s a lamp, or that it&#39;s anomalously durable. All they can understand is that there&#39;s something occupying some space and that it&#39;s anomalous. We work with things that are, on some level, fundamentally incompatible with our way of perceiving and processing information. Our job is to find a way to understand them anyway, and devise methods of containing them.

So, how do we do that? The answer, it turns out, is with a whole lot of drugs.

Some of you look surprised. That&#39;s not good. If you&#39;re surprised that working for this department involves a lot of heavy drug use, that means you didn&#39;t read the papers you signed when you agreed to this. In this department, you can&#39;t afford to not read the paperwork. If that&#39;s too much to ask, I suggest leaving now.

Anyway, drugs. The particularly astute among you may have noticed that I&#39;ve been careful so far to specify that the anomalies we work with here aren&#39;t compatible with //normal// human thought processes. It turns out that we think the way we do as a species because of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4923 something in our brains] that, under normal circumstances, prevents us from thinking differently. The specifics don&#39;t matter for this orientation. What does matter is that we&#39;ve created substances that allow us to get around this restriction and think in ways that enable us to comprehend what was once completely incomprehensible.

They&#39;re called Agnostics. You&#39;ll learn about the different kinds as they become relevant to your work. They let you rise above the singular way of processing information that you&#39;re used to, which allows you to understand things that you normally can&#39;t, particularly anomalies. Once you can understand them, you&#39;re equipped to contain them.

Of course, it&#39;s not always easy. Sometimes you&#39;re going to try a lot of different Agnostics until you find something that lets you comprehend the thing in front of you, and it&#39;s going to be unpleasant. You&#39;re also going to be isolated from the rest of the Foundation, because you won&#39;t be able to effectively communicate with them. The problem with taking drugs to alter your thought process is that your thought process [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5310 stops making sense to people who aren&#39;t also on the drugs.] I&#39;m just about the only person in Surrealistics who regularly talks to anybody outside of the department, and that&#39;s only because my position at the top of the ladder allows me to not constantly be on a cocktail of Agnostics for my work. Those among you who can&#39;t accept these downsides for whatever reason are more than welcome to back out.

As for the rest of you, welcome to the Department of Surrealistics. Your work begins tomorrow. We&#39;ll start by running some tests on you to figure out how many Agnostics you can down before your [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5145 teeth fall out.]</textarea></pre>

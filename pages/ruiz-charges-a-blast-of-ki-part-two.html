&#34;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&#34;

Ruiz’s palm began to glow, a light forming around his hand about the size of a small candle. 

Now, what do I mean by a candle? A candle is a tool used to light up a small area around itself. It is the precursor to more technological types of tools like a torch. 

Now, what do I mean by a torch? This might be a little confusing as &#34;torch&#34; can refer to two different lighting instruments: one created //before// the candle, and one created //after// the candle. In British English &#34;torch&#34; refers to what American English calls a &#34;flashlight&#34;. Flashlights were invented after the candle and utilize electricity to create light. 

Now, what do I mean by electricity? To explain that, I need to tell you a story.

----

Zeus looked around the marble and gold room and laughed.

“Haha, what a truly wonderful group of gods I see standing before me!”

In the feast hall of Olympus, Zeus stood before many other gods. He had called them all there because he had a new beautiful creation to share with them. He had been practicing for weeks. He raised his arm and shot out a bolt of lightning straight into Poseidon’s lower leg.

“Ow! Not cool, dude!”


“Yeah man, that’s our brother; pretty rude,.” Hades said, revealing himself from behind a few other gods.

“What are you even doing here?! I didn’t invite you! Also, wouldn’t you be into this?”

“Hey man, I know I take care of the underworld but I do it to riotously punish bad people. I don’t care much for our brother but he still didn’t deserve that shot to his leg. What do you call whatever you shot anyway?”

“I’m glad you asked. I call it... //Electricity//!”

And that’s how Electricity came to be!

----

So there you have it: Electricity was invented by Zeus.

Now, what do I mean by Invented? Everything I’ve told you about have been inventions. A lot of inventions utilize electricity. Microwaves, Fridges, Dish Washers, and Coffee Machines are just a few inventions that use Electricity. Do you know what all those inventions have in common? They are all used in the kitchen!

Now, what do I mean by Kitchen? A kitchen is a place where people prepare food. Kitchens have been around for centuries. Some older kitchens were just a plain room with a fire and cooking pot in them, most likely only lit by torches.

Now, what do I mean by torch? Torches were the precursor to a tool still used today, the candle! 

Now, what do I mea- wait, haven’t I already explained that? Speaking of, what was I even talking about? Oh yeah! Ruiz’s charge was about the size of a small candle or whatever.

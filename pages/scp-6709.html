**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has reached an agreement with the management of the server in question, and is slated to take over administration of the server, amnesticize all relevant server management, and return all involved individuals into non-anomalous society.

SCP-6709&#39;s completeness is to be maintained at all times. Any escape incidents or modification events are to be handled at Alpha-priority by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-418|Site-418]]].

The Ethics Committee has voted 7:6 in favor of a plan to draw more players into SCP-6709, using &#34;the hardest Minecraft experience&#34; as a tagline to attract players. Players shall be amnesticized upon ending their play session; in accordance with the Veil Protocol, players are to be told that this version of Minecraft has been modified for a more difficult experience.

The &#34;End Poem&#34; Protocol has been completed by a joint team from the Minecraft Division and Department of Enactment[[footnote]]A sub-department of the Pataphysics Department.[[/footnote]], and is currently in use to maintain containment within the lower narrative level of Minecraft. It consists of the following:

* Base Installation-A: A counterconceptual probe set up within SCP-6709 to destroy Nether Portal blocks, preventing SCP-6709 from entering the Nether. Four formations of MTF-Theta-98 (&#34;Nether Hunters&#34;) are stationed here to prevent SCP-6709 from using anomalous means to enter the Nether. They are authorized to use narrative-imprinting probes to execute SCP-6709 instances if necessary. It is noted that narrative-imprinting technology is currently not yet fully mature, and a better means of performing duties is currently being developed.

* Execution Installation-θ: A total of three facilities set up in End Portal rooms, preventing SCP-6709 from entering the End. The final line of defense is composed of four highly-armed players driven by &#34;Newborn&#34;-class AI systems operated by MTF-ま-6 (&#34;Branch Miners&#34;).

* Reset Installation-γ: Replaces the Endstone in the End dimension with End Crystals using conceptual injection, protecting the Vertex-class memetic entity from SCP-6709&#39;s influence. No further measures are necessary.

Several memetic injections have been authorized to inject various memetic concepts into SCP-6709, which have effectively reduced SCP-6709 containment breaches by approximately 25%. These include:

* Eight sets of anomalous memetic growth particles[[footnote]]Used to weaponize memes using memetic growth technology.[[/footnote]], which keep the player models within SCP-6709 in a continuous state of growth until they reach the maximum calculation limit while reducing the volume of units able to be manipulated by SCP-6709 to the point of imperceptibility.

* A total of seventeen molecular collapse units, which collectively reduced SCP-6709&#39;s incremental effect to under 10% of its original strength.

* A total of four &#34;Dyebath&#34;-98 reality-manipulation facilities, which sustain constant night and increase in chunk entity limits within SCP-6709.

**Description:** SCP-6709 is a multiplayer server for the popular video game Minecraft developed by Markus Persson and Mojang AB, known publicly as 2b2t. The server consists of an inner and outer layer; the outer layer is a standard unmoderated Minecraft &#34;anarchy&#34; server open to the public, while the inner layer is a hypothetical pocket dimension, which seemingly appears to be in the same narrative space as baseline reality[[footnote]]i.e. a narrative region on the same level[[/footnote]]. According to research and testing conducted by the Minecraft Division, SCP-6709 is a part of baseline reality; therefore, SCP-6709&#39;s core engine[[footnote]]currently the Enderdragon residing in the End dimension[[/footnote]] must not be destroyed. According to Foundation simulations, the destruction of this engine would lead to a ZK-Class end-of-the-world scenario on the entire narrative plane.

SCP-6709 is currently considered a Vertex-class memetic hallucination anomaly, and the Minecraft Division is attempting to prevent the completion of SCP-6709[[footnote]]in other words, the attainment of the Advancement &#34;Free the End&#34;[[/footnote]] and the collection of the resulting memetic entity[[footnote]]the &#34;Dragon Egg&#34; block[[/footnote]].

This version of Minecraft also possesses one or more anomalous components with non-game properties; it is theorized that this is primarily due to SCP-6709 modifying the game&#39;s source code to achieve some form of goal. At the same time, due to the diversity of its anomalous characteristics, it is confirmed that SCP-6709 is non-sapient and cannot single out blocks added by Foundation agents.

Currently, the area within a radius of ~2000 blocks of the spawn point of SCP-6709 is characterized by irregular block structure and biomes, and the possibility of human destruction has been ruled out. According to AI analysis, at least 620,000 blocks in this area are malformed, manifesting in the form of gravitational anomalies, illegal block properties[[footnote]]For instance, treating fluid blocks as solids and vice versa.[[/footnote]], and other irregularities.

Many deleted objects have been found in SCP-6709, and attempting to obtain these objects through commands causes the game to crash; attempting to re-enter the server displays a ban message, despite the fact that no ban or blacklist was issued.

A number of areas were found within SCP-6709 that do not match the characteristics of the original game, such as:

||~ Dimension||~ Coordinates (X, Y, Z)||~ Anomalies||~ Notes||
||Overworld||0, 0, 0||A 1x256x1 hole is present through the bedrock at the bottom of the world.||N/A||
||Overworld||150, 96, 150||A spider dungeon is present in the air.||No cobblestone or mossy cobblestone is present, only the spawner and chests.||
||Overworld||Entire area||Surface blocks are malformed, showing bulges and depressions, with occasional collapsed areas.||--Mainly composed of stone-like blocks-- Currently all grass blocks||
||Overworld||Dungeons||Approximately 10% of dungeons spawn creepers, of which 1% spawn charged creepers.||Creeper dungeons in explored areas have been marked Class-IV danger zones.||
||Overworld||Entire area||Obsidian cannot be generated from lava source blocks, while the spawning rules for blacksmith chests are irregular, making loot chests the only way of obtaining obsidian||N/A||
||Overworld||Below y=10||Completely filled with lava.||N/A||
||Overworld||Desert biomes||There is no way to place water blocks in deserts, and water in players&#39; inventories[[footnote]]including water bottles and buckets, but not potions[[/footnote]] will slowly disappear; after some time, the player will begin to lose health and die, with the death message being &#34;[player] was swallowed up&#34;.||It has been confirmed that the current version does not contain this death message; at the same time, when the player has not used any commands, the player&#39;s inventory will be kept, but all fluid containers[[footnote]]glass bottles, cauldrons, buckets, etc.[[/footnote]] will disappear.||
||Overworld||Savanna biomes||The clouds form the words &#34;Do not go into the night&#34;.||Suspected to be a cognitohazard; all subjects who directly viewed the clouds developed severe phobia of night.||
||Overworld||Around y=0||Some bedrock will be replaced with barrier blocks, while the sound of a child crying can be heard from the void below.||Do not respond under any circumstances.||
||Overworld||Entire area||Obsidian cannot be made from water and lava.||Bot players only obtained 3 obsidian after checking 1000 blacksmith chests, making access to the Nether very difficult.||
||Overworld||Villages||No iron golems, farms, priest or librarian villagers spawn; all villagers will attack the player before they can be traded with.||In the very few cases where priest and librarian villages were found, they did not trade Eyes of Ender or enchanted books, forcing the player to enter the End by gathering resources from the Nether.||
||Overworld||Villages||The generation of zombie villagers has increased by about 50%; their aggressiveness has also increased and they will grab the player&#39;s items. They also cannot be healed.||Of note is that 90% of zombie villagers will allow the player to escape before attacking.||
||Overworld||In natural caves under y=40||When the light level is less than 3, the area visible to the player will be covered in redstone and redstone torches.||Of note is that the secret room in a desert temple will also be subject to the same effect if the y-level is low enough.||
||Nether||Below y=10||Covered in an unknown liquid with no texture; there is no way to obtain it, and it behaves like water, with no harmful effects.||N/A||
||Nether||Some nether fortresses||The spawn rate of wither skeletons is drastically increased; no blazes are spawned. The original blaze spawner now spawns 4-6 magma cubes, wither skeletons, ghasts or other Nether mobs; in rare cases, all the spawners in the fortress are inactive zombie spawners.||N/A||
||Nether||Within 50 blocks of a nether fortress||In one cycle [[footnote]]Approximately 14 seconds.[[/footnote]], 4-6 blazes are spawned; AI players confirmed that they do not drop blaze rods on death after killing over 15000 blazes.||Blaze attack power appears to be approximately 30% higher than in non-anomalous versions.||
||Nether||Entire area||Soul sand does not spawn.||N/A||
||Nether||y=20 to y=80||No nether quarts ore spawns in this area.||Any attempts to create or spawn nether quartz leads to the player&#39;s game crashing.||

-----
[[&lt;]]
//Before starting the game, you must take note of the following rules; this will be a great help in completing the game.//
[[/&lt;]]
-----
[[size larger]] **RULES** [[/size]]
[[&lt;]]
**1.** Please ensure you wear the special glasses we have provided for you; this will let you discover more interesting and challenging things in the game. If you do not wear these glasses, you may encounter increased difficulty. We are sure you would not like to try.

**2.** Please ensure that when you enter the game, you spawn in the overworld, and not next to a bed in the Nether or the End. If you spawn at either of these locations, contact us immediately; we will change your account and refund you double for your loss. Please note that you will no longer own the previous account after exchanging it.

**3.** In order to make the game more challenging, we have set the map to always be night; we have also added various modifications to enhance the challenge, so don&#39;t be surprised when you discover creatures or buildings that don&#39;t exist in this version. However, the hotbar won&#39;t be affected, nor will the crafting guide or shield slot.

**4.** As we&#39;re still in the testing phase, the AI players and code errors you see in the game are normal; please feel free to contact our staff if you feel it disrupts your play. They are at your service 24/7, after all.

**5.** We want to keep the original mining gameplay, so you are encouraged to explore abandoned mineshafts, and to this end we have increased the mineral spawn rate and generation rate of abandoned mineshafts. However, you won&#39;t find any ore above y=30; this is for the sake of greater excitement. If you find an ore where there shouldn&#39;t be one, please contact our programmer who will fix the bug within 20 minutes.

**6.** Spiders are friendly creatures, both normal spiders and cave spiders. As such, do not harm spiders. Do not look directly into the spiders&#39; eyes, as doing so will make them feel offended. Cave spiders will only appear in abandoned mineshafts, and will guide you to the loot chests; they will not attack you. Therefore, when you encounter a cave spider that attacks you outside an abandoned mineshaft, do not fight back; instead, run away as quickly as possible, preferably unharmed. After that, report this to the programmer, but you may not use the word &#34;spider&#34;; you are recommended to use other words, like &#34;many-legged creature&#34;.

**7.** If you were killed by a cave spider outside an abandoned mineshaft, please enter the nearest forest biome, where you will be safe, immediately after respawning. Then report the situation to the programmer; in this case, the above clause is nullified and you must use the word &#34;spider&#34; to report it. After this, please stay in the forest for 20 minutes, after which you may continue playing.

**8.** The Nether and End are currently not open in this game; you may not access them normally. However, you shouldn&#39;t be entering them anyway.

**9.** Kill all the green creatures you see; this will give you plenty of rewards and drops.

**10.** Water blocks do not protect against explosions; you can still survive an explosion by placing a block with blast resistance in the direction of the explosion.

**11.** Spiders&#39; bodies are black, with red eyes on their heads, and eight legs. They only spawn in the overworld. Spiders are not made of glowstone, and they do not produce light; they do not spawn in the Nether. The glowstone spiders you see are a neutral boss entity, which only drops items if four players attack it at once, so don&#39;t attack them if you don&#39;t have enough people.

**12.** Do not explore in a thunderstorm unless you want to constantly fight charged creepers. The ninth clause is nullified in a thunderstorm. Keep yourself safe and your environment closed.

**13.**The game is locked in hard mode, so please use stone to build your shelters. Zombies and creepers will tear apart wooden structures without mercy.

**14.** Please do not summon the wither without the consent of the server administrator. Wither skeleton skulls can be exchanged for powerful items.

**15.** After you complete the game, please select a successor to play the game.

//Remarks: All records have been decrypted, and abnormal records are presumed to be the result of AI agents being affected by anomalies.//
------
//[Begin Recording]//

**00.00：**[Jiu_Huan joined the game]

**00.06：**[RuRI joined the game] At this point the network fluctuation increases.

**00.08：**The preset generation is complete; the AI has restored a map of the 10000x10000 area around the spawn point using seed simulation.

**00.12：**Redstone is generated around the player, and redstone dust can be observed on the sides and top of blocks; 32% of the redstone dust is powered.

**00.20：**TNT is used to verify that the powered redstone possesses identical characteristics to that of the main game.

**00.32：**Investigation continues; the topography of the savanna and desert biomes are confirmed, including abandoned mineshafts exposed on the surface.

**00.56：**AI players are instructed to explore the mineshaft; its highest point is y=89, while no ore or blocks other than wooden fences and planks that make up the mineshaft structure are generated in the area above y=30. No hostile mobs or other entities are generated.

**01.02：**AI players reach y=30; the sounds of zombies, skeletons and other hostiles are heard, and the AI is instructed to prepare for battle.

**01.03：**AI encounters hostile mobs.

**01.03：**AI attempts to attack the hostiles; no damage was dealt. The hostile mobs did not attack the player and continued to produce the same sound. It is confirmed that the AI is not in spectator mode.

**01.04：**AI is instructed to save a keyframe; at this point the bulk of the hostile mobs are darkened and redstone dust and redstone torches generate around the player.

**01.05：**AI continues to explore downward, killing six players in the process --and eating them whole.--

**01.36：**AI arrives at the bottom of the mine, y=11, and is ordered to dig a passage to the void.

**01.98：**AI reaches y=1 and begins to break the bedrock.

**02.11：**AI breaks the bedrock --and enters the Nether.--

**02.12：**##red|[You died! Jiu_Huan was swallowed by the void]##

##red|**22.22：**[You died! Jiu_Huan has no place to hide]##

**03.01：**AI considers the bedrock unbreakable and returns to the origin area.

**30.10：**AI reaches (0, 0, 0).

**33.33：**##red|[You died! Jiu_Huan returned to nature]##

##red|**33.33：**[You died! Jiu_Huan is powerless to break free and is swallowed by the laws of nature]##

**33.34：**##red|Powerlessness, relaxing, the finality of it all. No, no, that&#39;s not right.##

**33.48：**A total of 1 remaining AI player was instructed to travel to the Nether using the constructed Nether Portal block created via narrative imprinting.

**35.25：**AI reaches the Nether. The signal is poor, with a delay of 3600ms.

**35.25：**[Cognitohazard removed]

**35.36：**##red|Fading away and rebirth, ah, no, right and wrong, truth and lies, everything in the world. Yes, yes, William, that is the answer you seek.##

**36.24：**AI arrives at the selected area and is instructed to save a keyframe.

**36.99：**--##red|[This is how everything ends, RuRI.]##--

**37.21：**AI enters the Nether Fortress and confirms anomalies in the area.

**37.22：**AI discovers a spawner, approaches it, and does not react.

**38.22：**Spawner completes its first round, spawning (from first to last): zombie pigman, baby zombie pigman, wither skeleton, ghast, skeleton.

**39.52：**Spawner completes its second round, spawning (from first to last): pigman, pig, zombie pig, [unknown], blue wither skeleton head.

**40.00：**AI finishes processing spawner and continues onward.

**41.25：**##red|[Cognitohazard removed]##

**41.25：**##red|You cannot escape, not now, not in the future.##

**45.32：**According to the AI&#39;s data report, any exploration of terrain or structures in the Nether is prohibited; if any occurs, it is to be referred to the Site-418 internal affairs team.

**46.25：**AI discovers an anomalous phenomenon.

**46.25：**AI decides to approach.

**46.26：**AI found the anomaly was terrain, and decided to enter.

**47.26：**AI has entered, AI cannot enter, AI has escaped.

**48.22：**##red|I think we need it. We need all of it.##

**48.25：**##red|Natural selection will correct all of the fallacies here, and I, in turn, will work with you to correct it.##

**55.55：**##red|Nature has destroyed this place. Everything in this world should be as it is at the end, but only this place remained. Yes, only this place.##

**55.55：**##red|Quarks, atoms, molecules; the sun and the moon, the stars and the sea, the mountains and the earth, wind and fire. I have been called the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-2740 traveler] from the mountains, I have been called the fish at the bottom of the sea. I have dreamt of hunting and being hunted, creating a kingdom from the peak of the highest mountain to the depths of the deepest caves.##

**55.55：**##red|I am a part of this place, and so are you. But I know you are not here at all, and that you are reading my mind.##

**55.55：**AI discovers an anomalous phenomenon and decides to attack.

**55.66：**AI attacks the anomaly. AI is attacked by the anomaly.

**55.99：**AI creates. AI destroys. In the midst of beginning and end, heaven and earth overturn.

**66.12：**AI has no way to defeat the anomaly. AI decides to flee. AI has no means to accomplish this.

**66.23：**##red|Following AI discovery protocol, this protocol has been terminated and all data has been transferred.##

**70.00：**AI is destroyed. Mission complete.

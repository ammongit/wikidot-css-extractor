**Item #:** SCP-6542

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6542 is to be kept in a porcelain tub in Site-120. One member of D-class personnel must bathe inside the tub at least once a week.

Upon exiting the tub, medical personnel are to clean the individual. Special attention is to be paid to their feet.
 
**Description:** SCP-6542 is a large volume of anomalously-preserved milk that must be bathed in on a regular basis. If the milk is not bathed in for a period longer than one week, a murky shadow begins to form on the surface of SCP-6542. A lactoderm will then begin to form that contains traces of endometrial cells.

All individuals who observe this shadow have described extreme and debilitating feelings of dread, anxiety and guilt.

 **Addendum 1 (Discovery of SCP-6542)**: SCP-6542 was discovered in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in its current state in 200█ during an inquisition by the Foundation, found within a concealed baptistery. The anomaly was surrendered to Foundation custody. Scrawled on the side of the tub was verse Job 10:10 from the King James Bible, reading:

&gt; &#34;Hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese?&#34;

When originally discovered, MTF-Squad Alpha-64 &#34;Got Milk&#34; described there being a partial silhouette of a human inside the milk tub.

The silhouette was described reaching out for the surface of the milk with severely wounded palms.

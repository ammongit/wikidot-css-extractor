**SCP-6741:** The Corruption of our Minds
**Author:** ESB2109
**Content Warning!:**Briefly touches on subjects of Murder.
**Writer&#39;s Notes:** Hello! This article differs wildly from the usual format of the Foundation. I decided to mix it up and do something different. 


**PLEASE READ** This article has more than meets the eye, if you did not realise. If you are reading on mobile, it may not work properly, or be a bit jankey.

++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION 

SCP-6741 has been deemed to be mislabelled as an anomaly. Staff are to ignore this file. No anomaly is present.

-- The O5 Council


[[/=]]
[[/div]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6741 does not need to be contained. SCP-6741 is safe and poses no risk to the Foundation or life. The Overseer Council orders no containment procedures are present for this low-risk threat. SCP-6741 has been decommissioned.

**Description:** SCP-6741 is has no physical form. Its abilities are irrelevant. 


##transparent| If you are reading this, the Ethics Committee needs you. We believe **you** could be key in saving the foundation. MTF-Omega-1 needs all the help we can. For Humanity &amp; The Foundation.##

##transparent| The Ethics Committee has gained information into SCP-6741. It does exist. It is a danger. It must be destroyed. Many sentient entities know of SCP-6741, but do not believe it is anomalous. It is referred to as &#34;Corruption&#34; by humanity. It has controlled many world leaders, but has never reached this level of power.##

##transparent| SCP-6741 is waiting for its opportunity. SCP-6741 controls the O5 Council. SCP-6741 controls the Foundation. **SCP-6741 is the Foundation.** ##

##transparent| The SCP Foundation once worked to protect life from the shadows. SCP-6741 has changed this. SCP-6741 is believed to have taken control of the O5 Council. With its newfound control, it has made staff believe it is not a threat. ##

##transparent| SCP-6741 controls the minds of those with power. SCP-6741 has no physical form. The only way to remove it from an entity is to terminate its hosts.##

##transparent| SCP-6741 is believed  to plan to become a supreme world government and control humanity alone. If it controls, it will destroy humanity to ensure its own power.##

##transparent| If you are loyal in protecting humanity, the O5 Councillors must be terminated, In the name of Humanity. Do not speak to anyone regarding this message. ##

##transparent| Assuming we succeed, the O5 Council will be dissolved. A new democratic council will have to be formed, with power spread throughout the foundation. No single entity too powerful. The leading council will be The Democratic Committee of Containment, although their power will be limited.##

##transparent| SCP-6741 is waiting for its opportunity. It plans. It will control. It will dominate.##

##transparent| You will be made aware in person on what to do. **Long live the New Foundation. Long Live Humanity.**##</textarea></pre>

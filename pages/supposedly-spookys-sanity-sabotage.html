You unlock this door with the key of imagination
Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind
You’re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas

[[tab A Basic Introduction to Insanity and His Offspring]]
So, this is embarrassing. Bet you expected some super clinical and revelatory page, huh? Well, now that you&#39;re here...

In all seriousness, I really like trying to show different sides of humanity through my creations, whether that be empathy or monstrosity[[footnote]] Not sure if that&#39;s even a way to use that word, but we&#39;re running with it. [[/footnote]]. Observe.

**[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5807 |Pelicans Three, AKA SCP-5807]]]** 
My first and unnecessarily long SCP about the quiet but nice kid, the dick, and the babie(TM), but in the end, they&#39;re all talking pelicans looking for greater meaning and an old lady. 
P.S. If you recognize the title reference you&#39;re a real one.

**[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5339 |And He Rose Again With a Third Leg, AKA SCP-5339]]]**
I&#39;m actually really proud of this one and I&#39;m sort of gauging my success on any further articles by this one. It&#39;s about a nice vacation a malformed child and his mother have where the kid was definitely not drowned by his mother and reincarnated to seek unwitting revenge on her. Nice read, will not ruin your day.

**[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5622 |Your Indoor Neighbor, AKA SCP-5622]]]**
//I get it. Good idea, bad presentation.// Should I fix it? Yes. Will I? --Yeah-- No, but like, let me finish other stuff first.

**[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5739 |ELEPHANT HIDE, AKA SCP-5793]]]**
So I literally just posted this, so I have no idea how well it&#39;s going to do, but I honestly feel really good about it. It&#39;s a short horror SCP that leaves mysterious notes written on skin. There&#39;s a lot of things about this SCP that you&#39;ll have to infer for yourself, but personally, I prefer it that way. It&#39;s... shall I say... not only skin deep? (Badum-tss)

You fool! You released //them//! Oh well, better tell you what they are and why they&#39;re here. I make Found Footage art[[footnote]] The style utilized by artists like Trevor Henderson, Leovincible, and others. [[/footnote]] Here are some of my favorite pieces done by yours truly.

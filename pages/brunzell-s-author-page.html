+ About Me
I&#39;m just a Swedish pastry with an interest in writing, reading and teaching. I have a passion for equity in schools and the environment. I like all kinds of articles on the wiki but I generally have a preference against enabling too unrealistic concepts. I know everything on here is hella unrealistic but I believe there is a spectrum as well.    


+ Underread Articles
I do this thing where I look through older and newer articles below a rating of 30 without many comments (or very old comments) and leave a crit just to try and bump the article in any direction toward a more fitting range. Hopefully I have made some articles accepted, and some acknowledged etc. I have without a doubt read more articles below 30 than above.  

++ This particular time, I recommend reading [[[SCP-5229]]]. 
[[div style=&#34;background:#f3d9d7;padding:10px;margin:5px;padding:10px;&#34;]]
//SCP-5229 is an anomalous human skeleton, with the notable structural difference of SCP-5229’s foot bones, hand bones, facial bones, and cranial bones being fused together into solid plates. Due to the particular structure created by the fusion, SCP-5229’s extremities resemble fins, and SCP-5229’s skull resembles an open-circuit diving helmet. The faceplate of the skull is composed of keratin, giving SCP-5229’s “visor” the approximate appearance of a fingernail.//

//Despite being heavily abnormal in structure and appearance, SCP-5229’s anomalous qualities will only manifest in the event that any portion of SCP-5229 is not in direct contact with liquid. When SCP-5229 becomes active, it will proceed to animate, move towards the nearest source of water, and submerge itself, becoming inactive.//

+ My Articles
I have also produced text myself.

[[[SCP-5342]]] - Midsomer Murders

[[[SCP-5439]]] - Nose Itch
Around this time it&#39;s been a boom of short articles. I got a nose itch one day and immediately thought of this scene under 500 words.

[[[SCP-5294]]] - The Emancipatory Society for Middle-Aged Fathers
Ever wondered where all the middle-aged dads come from? I wrote this simply because I think jokes about dads being useless are funny.

[[[SCP-6201]]] - Trolls
This is not only an homage to the mythological creature but to those who were severely mistreated by Swedish authorities at the beginning of the 20th century. 

[[[SCP-5930]]] - The Bride of Christ
If we would believe in an eternal life, would we be able to cherish our life? This one is a cool concept that I used for the Cupidcon-contest. I was inspired by the [[[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3xGrXfxf9g|Knutby sect]]] where one person was murdered and another seriously wounded by one of the members after manipulation by the pastor in the Pentecostal church.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sisters-contribution|Sister&#39;s Contribution]]] - Sister&#39;s Contribution
A November-themed story about a sister literally nurturing her brothers with pieces of herself.</textarea></pre>

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Life is hell for humanoid anomalies.

Between a corrupt Ethics Committee, a paranoid O5, self-serving researchers who see humanoids as resources rather than people, and MTF agents required to be prejudice and dehumanizing, it suddenly makes sense why 72% of all humanoid SCPs will at some point be on suicide watch.

Of course, there are those who are disgusted by such actions. Those whose compassion and sympathy outweigh their lust for cheating at life.

It&#39;s only a matter of time before shit hits the fan.

[[div class=&#34;content-panel standalone series&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFFF;&#34;]]

++ **David Black**

**Born:** 06/03/1975

**Occupation:** Infantry, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Agent Black takes his job seriously. He understands that he lives in a dark world, and without him, terrible things would happen. Anomalies must be contained to keep the world from spiraling into chaos.

But he&#39;s always struggled when the things he needs to contain are people. Forcing innocents into a life of confinement and solitary simply for defying normality is starting to effect him mentally. He doesn&#39;t know how much longer he can do this job.

------

++ **Jessica Milo**

**Born:** 01/22/1976

**Occupation:** Sharpshooter, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Agent Milo is currently seeking asylum with the Foundation. She was recruited shortly after the death of her father, whom she killed for murdering her boyfriend.

Milo has always had issues with following orders. While not serious enough for any severe reprimands,  it has caused her career as an MTF agent to stagnate. With that being said, Agent Milo is an exceptional shot, scoring a 1050 on her marksman exam which landed her the role of sharpshooter.

She&#39;s in tight with Agent Black, and is sure to follow him wherever he goes.

------

++ **Charles Rigby**

**Born:** 03/18/1975

**Occupation:** Transport Pilot/Mechanic, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Being a pilot and a mechanic, Agent Rigby doesn&#39;t do much in terms of fighting. Instead, he gets the people who are fighting where they need to be.

Rigby was recruited into the Foundation following an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP-682] containment breach. During the breach, 682 managed to reach New York City, severely damaging the █████████ ███████ building. Due to the sheer number of witnesses, most were recruited into the Foundation, Rigby being one of them.

Unlike Black and Milo, Rigby doesn&#39;t show signs of insubordination, though this may be due to his role as a pilot rather than an infantryman or sharpshooter. Still, he has a close relationship with the two, and is bound to stand by them.

------

++ **James Albany**

**Born:** 10/29/1968

**Occupation:** Infantry, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Son of Agent Collin Albany and Dr Alison Albany, James has spent his entire life with the Foundation. He entered the Cadet program at age 16, and officially joined MTF when he turned 18.

Albany strongly values loyalty, to the point of near obsession. He does what he&#39;s told without question, no matter what. This mindset was formed following [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-scottish-goliath Incident S108-RCI-117], during which Albany witnessed his mother&#39;s death at the hands of the Chaos Insurgency.

His unyielding loyalty and willingness to do what needs to be done has made him a favorite amongst the upper ranks.

------

++ **Riley Jaxon**

**Born:** 02/29/1968

**Occupation:** Infantry, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Agent Jaxon is the youngest senior officer in Foundation history, achieving the rank of Colonel at age 27. This was done so after an infamous GoI raid, during which Jaxon&#39;s squad commander was killed. She took charge of the remaining forces and drove the raiders from the site.

Jaxon has been described to be &#39;the perfect balance between compassion and doing what needs to be done.&#39; As such, she has garnered a significant amount of respect both from her subordinates and superiors.

Jaxon also has a long history with Agent Albany.

------

++ **John Brian**

**Born:** Unknown

**Occupation:** Infantry, Delta-4 (&#34;Minutemen&#34;)

**Bio:** Not much is known about Agent Brian. Even the Foundation was barely able to dig up anything from his past. All that&#39;s known about his time prior to MTF was that he was born somewhere in Pennsylvania and probably grew up on a farm.

Brian joined the Foundation after driving to Site-19 and requesting to join MTF. When asked how he knew the location of Site-19, he merely shrugged. Despite the background check returning basically nothing, there was no evidence to suggest him being a spy for a rival GoI. As such, he was allowed to conscript.

//&#34;I don&#39;t know who, but SOMEONE approved of Brian being allowed to keep that stupid helmet on. He&#39;s wearing it in his agent profile, and no one... not even the agents on his task force... has seen his face. Something&#39;s up with this guy, I swear.&#34; -Major Carlson, Delta-4//

------

++ **Iris Thompson**

**Born:** 05/12/1988

**Occupation:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-105 SCP-105], Omega-7 (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;)

**Bio:** Iris Thompson was brought into Foundation custody following the murder of her boyfriend, of which she claimed to have seen through a photograph. She was transported to Site-17 after her ability was confirmed.

Iris agreed to join Omega-7 (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;) in exchange for greater privileges and looser restrictions. Despite her conscription being controversial with some, she has proven herself invaluable.

However, Iris has shown early signs of mental health deterioration. It is unclear if this is because of her time on Omega-7, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beyond-the-depths-part6 witnessing the death of her boyfriend], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beyond-the-depths-part3 witnessing the death of her brother], sudden and extreme exposure to the anomalous world, or isolation caused by her Special Containment Procedures.

------

++ **Nathanael Cornwall**

**Born:** 09/04/1970

**Occupation:** Detective, Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;)

**Bio:** Detective Cornwall started his career with the Foundation at the Department of Analytics, which investigates and solves cases relating to incidents relating with SCP objects. He later joined Omega-1 after being asked to by its commander, Henry Parker.

Cornwall is smart. He has always been able to piece bits of a puzzle together, which is why he was so highly regarded by the departments he worked for. He also has a strong sense of ethics, which is one of the reasons he joined Omega-1 in the first place.

------

++ **Henry Parker**

**Born:** 05/08/1945

**Occupation:** Commander, Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;)

**Bio:** Commander Parker is the definition of breaking the mold. He acts in ways that no other MTF commander does, such as joining his soldiers in battle and declassifying his name to the lower ranks. He has been described as charismatic and a natural leader.

Parker is also a strategic and tactical genius. All of his missions, whether they&#39;re small extraction ops or a massive siege of a GoI base, have been absolute successes. No small part because of his brilliant mind. Many higher ranking officers wonder why Parker wastes his talent on commanding Omega-1.

------

++ **Amelia Hayes**

**Born:** 07/14/1980

**Occupation:** Site-17 Humanoid Counselor

**Bio:** Doctor Hayes joined the Foundation at the early age of 21 after witnessing SCP-682 rampage through New York City. Specializing in psychology and mental health, Hayes&#39;s job is to act as a counselor and friendly face to humanoid SCPs kept at Site-17. However, the cold attitude the Foundation chose to adopt often clashes with Hayes&#39;s desire to help humanoid anomalies.

After losing [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6303 SCP-6303] to suicide, Hayes vowed that she would do her best to treat humanoid SCPs as equal. This often gets to her in hot water with Doctor Eliza.

------

++ **Elizabeth Eliza**

**Born:** 01/26/1959

**Occupation:** Site-17&#39;s Head of Medium-Risk Anomalies

**Bio:** Daughter of the esteemed Doctor Boris Eliza, Elizabeth was raised with the expectations of becoming a great doctor within the Foundation. These expectations were met when she became the Head of Medium-Risk Anomalies at Site-17.

Eliza is a cold, ruthless woman. D-Class are recourses, other doctors are colleagues, and anomalies are object... even the human ones. Eliza&#39;s lack of discriminating between horrendous monsters and people with abilities has given her the reputation as a cold-blooded, heartless pragmatist.

[[div class=&#34;content-panel standalone series&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #FFFFFF;&#34;]]

++ **The Foundation**

The Foundation is evil, plain and simple. They are a bureaucracy whose only goal is to maintain the status quo, no matter the cost. Because of this, corruption is rampant amongst the ranks, and it isn&#39;t uncommon for the O5 council to break the very rules they set in place.

------

++ **The Ethics Committee**

Similar to the O5 and Foundation as a whole, the Ethics Committee is rotten to the core with corruption. Members will turn a blind eye to unethical practices if it means they themselves can benefit.

------

++ **The Chaos Insurgency**

Formed in 1947, the Insurgency believes that the Ethics Committee&#39;s restrictions and the O5&#39;s reluctance to utilize anomalies on a large scale is holding the Foundation, and humanity, back from greatness. Unlike the Hand, they seek to use anomalies to make humanity a race of gods, and care little about moral or ethical concerns.

Delta-4 acts as an extreme rapid response unit that specialize in being the first to the scene. Their roles include establishing a perimeter, evacuating civilians, and making first contact with the anomaly in question. They also provide additional manpower to the task forces on the op, aiding in broad-job assignments.

------

++ Omega-7 (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;)

[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/task-forces/Omega7.jpg/small.jpg width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

Omega-7 is the first task force to utilize humanoid SCPs. Specifically, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 SCP-076-2] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-105 SCP-105]. They&#39;re only called in when a situation gets out of hand, or when a task force needs help dealing with a GoI.

------

++ Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;)

[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/472222098090098688/935239457790103593/dcwyfvh-280425e7-56c5-4d3f-93a1-5019b7124f04.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

Omega-1 acts as the Ethic Committee&#39;s personal task force. They enact their will within the Foundation, and investigate potential ethical violations. As such, Omega-1 is mainly made up of detectives and investigators, though it does have a spec op branch. It is sorely underfunded and understaffed.

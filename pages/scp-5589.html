**Item #:** SCP-5589

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation personnel are forbidden to enter within 5 miles of Clark&#39;s Creek, Massachusetts. As SCP-5589 takes on no anomalous properties whilst under this condition, no other containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5589 is the collective designation for a series of approximately 300 frogs, toads, newts, and several other unidentified species of amphibian currently living within the vicinity of Clark&#39;s Creek, Massachusetts.

 SCP-5589&#39;s primary anomalous property can be observed in the unnaturally high level of coordination among its members, with instances often cooperating for the purpose of crafting rudimentary weaponry for use in organized attacks against Foundation personnel. Examples have included:
* An assortment of primitive &#39;cannons&#39; that dismantle themselves after a single use. It is unknown whether this is a necessary consequence of the devices&#39; operation or an intentional mechanism to prevent capture
* Several whips woven from poison ivy
* A large tree, repurposed by SCP-5589 as a factory for the mass-production of spears, javelins, and other similar armaments
* Catapults which fire newt feces
* Chariots mounting earthworms   
* Complex military-grade weaponry of unknown origin[[footnote]] See Discovery [[/footnote]]

**Discovery:** SCP-5589 was discovered on June 5th, 1999, when it attacked Foundation construction workers in the process of draining Clark&#39;s Creek to develop Site-██[[footnote]] Later decommissioned upon discovery of SCP-5589. [[/footnote]].

After one worker was killed and four others injured, provisional Site Director Jonathan Chen dispatched a small militarized strike team to address the situation. The following is a transcript of said incident:

According to witness testimony by Agent Carson, it was at this point that SCP-5589 fired its &#39;Laser Ray&#39;, which is said to have produced a high-octane thaumatological laser beam, instantly turning Commander Radley into a large Bull Frog. Foundation attempts to reverse this effect have thus far been unsuccessful. 

It is currently unknown how SCP-5589 obtained the materials to create such a weapon. Possible Euclid reclassification is pending.
